      <p><strong>Get VIP Service Everywhere</strong></p>
        &bull; Recognized &amp; greeted by name<br />
		  &bull; Businesses know your preferences<br />
    <p>Walk into your favorite place, be greeted by name by a staff that already anticipates your wishes.<br />Example: Walk into a hotel, and the bell hop brings you your room key before you ever get to the counter.  The salesperson at the mall knows your size before you even ask for help.<br />It\'s entirely up to you to share as much, or as little, as you want each type of business to know.</p>
      <p><strong>Simplify your life!</strong></p>
        &bull; Lose that stack of cards - just carry your mobile phone
    <p>Leave that stack of cards at home.  All you need is your mobile phone.<br />Go to the gym, and walk past the counter without doing anything.<br />Don\'t hassle with a ticket at the parking garage--it\'s one more thing to lose.  Just carry your mobile phone and pay on the phone when you leave.<br />Walk into the airport and skip all the lines and the kiosks.  Without touching a button, your mobile phone will show you the gate information and can check you in automatically.<br />Save money by participating in customer loyalty programs without having to carry another card.</p>
    <p><strong>Protect yourself.</strong></p>
        &bull; Secure yet anonymous<br />
		  &bull; Protect yourself from identity theft<br />
		  &bull; Provide personal information only when you want to - accurately<br />
		  &bull; No data stored in phone--ok to lose it<br />
    <p>Absolutely no information is stored on the phone.  If you lose it, the finder can do nothing with it--unlike a wallet.  Any personal information you wish to store is heavily encrypted in a central database, and can only be unlocked when you enter your PIN on the mobile phone.  Not even the PlutoVIP staff has access to it--your data is never shared.<br /> Further if you choose to make payments with your mobile phone, the payment information always remains encrypted.  The business will never receive your credit card number, so you are protecting yourself against fraud and identity theft.</p>
     <p><strong>Meet that special someone</strong></p>
    <p> When you sign up for PlutoVIP, just check off that you\'re interested in meeting new people.  Then, when you go out and see someone you\'d like to meet, but don\'t have the opportunity to introduce yourself, check back on the PlutoVIP web-site.  You will see a list of all the places you\'ve been, and the other PlutoVIP\'s who were there around the same time, if they also specified that they would like to meet new people.  You can then send them a message through the PlutoVIP system, although no personal information, including the email address, will ever be revealed.<br /> Online dating blends into the social scene.</p>
