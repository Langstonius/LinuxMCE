<b>Letter from the Pluto Team</b><br>
<p>The electronic devices we rely on every day, from our phone to our VCR, are combinations of
hardware and software. Since pc computers are so widespread, reliable and inexpensive,
more and more devices are using standard pc components inside. Nearly all high end
entertainment products, like personal video recorders, whole-house music solutions, and so
on, are essentially modified pc-computers inside a custom enclosure. With Pluto as well, the
Core, the Media Directors and the Orbiters, are all customized pc-computers.</p>
<p>Open source has undeniably become the software platform of choice for these products. Open
source refers to software that the owner basically gives away for free, including all the source
code, which is needed for someone to enhance it, modify it, or fix it. The stipulation is that
any improvements must be contributed back to the project so everyone benefits.</p>
<p>Mainstream consumers do not hear much about open source software because it is free, and
so there is no company marketing it. Most still use proprietary, closed-source software, like
Windows, on their personal computers. However, we all use open source every day even if
we’re not aware of it. Open source has proven to be such a superior approach to deliver
powerful and stable solutions that it has taken over the behind the scenes, mission critical
applications. The infrastructure of the internet is based on open source. It powers all the
major industries, like Banking and Telecommunications. And it is the platform of choice for all
the small embedded computers inside everything from our cars to our appliances.</p>
<p>These products use open source software, like the Linux operating system, as a base, add their
own, proprietary software, and deliver their own branded product. This method, which Pluto
used for its 1s t generation pro duct, has proven very successful. Many popular household
products do the same thing.</p>
<p>However, starting with our series 2, Pluto is doing something quite unconventional. We are
releasing all our patent-pending proprietary software as open source too, and have re-written
it so that it can run not only on our own customized hardware, but on standard PC’s as well.
Why would we do this since the proprietary software is usually a company’s most carefully
guarded trade secret? Giving the software away for free sounds like an odd way for a profitminded
company to succeed.</p>
<p>Actually not. Pluto’s typical customers do not want to mess with technology. They want a box
that they can plug in, push ‘on’ and that will work immediately, simplifying their lives. We
know our customer base and are confident they will continue to buy our pre-packaged Pluto
systems, as opposed to getting PC computers, adding some specialized components, then
downloading and installing the free software.</p>
<p>However we also know another big item on our customers’ wish lists. Once they start using
Pluto, they want everything in the home to work like Pluto does. We constantly get requests
to add an interface module to control, say, a type of pool control popular in South Africa. Or a
dealer in Thailand wants a Thai-version of the Orbiter. This is one way that making Pluto open
source will benefit our customers—now anyone, anywhere in the world can add such plug-ins
to expand the functionality of Pluto, and it will become available for everyone.</p>
<p>Pluto’s DCE protocol has proven to be the most efficient and practical way to allow everything
in the home to work together seamlessly. Our biggest obstacle promoting DC E as a universal
standard is that no manufacturer likes to be tied to a closed, proprietary standard they cannot
control. That’s why manufacturers tend to use their own proprietary standards, and competing
products never work together even though that is high on a customer’s wish list. Has anyone
ever seen a DVD player from Brand X that automatically adjusts the settings on a TV from
Brand Y, like all DCE devices do? Making DCE a free, open standard will encourage more
manufacturers to support it. Then our customers will enjoy more products that seamlessly
blend into the home, working exactly as expected without a user’s manual.
Of course this new approach is great for those who would like to enjoy Brilliant Living without
the expense, and are willing to build their own Pluto systems.</p>
<p>Finally we hope this will be a great asset to the open source community, with whom Pluto has
always had an excellent relationship. While most companies try to hide the “secret” that their
products are based on open source and they didn’t develop everything in house, Pluto actively
promoted this arrangement. In fact, Pluto is virtually the only company that sought out the
core developers of the major open source projects we built our product upon, brought them to
Florida to work side by side with our own staff, giving them nice condos, new cars, good
compensation, and even stock in the company so they would enjoy the benefits of Pluto’s
success. Even though their open source projects are embedded in myriads of other products,
no other company even acknowledged their contributions.</p>
<p>Since Pluto is now becoming an embedded platform that will be integrated in a variety of
consumer products, from cars to televisions, Pluto is an easy way for the scores of developers
who have already made fantastic, high-quality open source projects to offer them to the
general public. Once they make their project a DCE-compatible plug-in, any Pluto user, even a
total technophobe, can press a couple buttons on the mobile phone and start using it.
Of course our customers can rest assured that any contributions submitted by the open source
community will only make their way into our retail product only after passing our exhaustive
testing and quality assurance process. Stability and easy of use will continue to be trademarks
of the Pluto product.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a customer, an open source developer, or one who builds your own Pluto
system, we hope you enjoy Brilliant Living.</p>
The Pluto Team
