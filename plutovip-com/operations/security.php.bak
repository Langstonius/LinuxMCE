      <p>&bull;<strong> <a name="notification"></a>Immediate notification of any alerts on mobile phone with video (patent pending)</strong><br>
      The instant anything important happens at your home, such as a security breach, fire or even someone ringing the doorbell, your mobile phone will beep and show you a live video feed. You are in full control. 1 button turns on the lights, tv's and stereo's, turning the whole house into a giant speakerphone so you can speak to the person. If it's a delivery, you can unlock the door, let him in, tell him where to leave the package, and lock up again when he's done. If it's an intruder, you can let him know you're watching him as you call the police.</p>
      <p>The important point is that Pluto makes a 911 call from the house--patching you in on the cell--so the police see a real emergency--not another monitored alarm call--and, therefore, respond right away. You can tell the police exactly what's happening.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="watch" id="watch"></a>Watch &amp; speak to intruders from anywhere with your mobile (patent pending)</strong><br>
      A Pluto media director automatically turns your television into a hands-free, video-capable phone. So, when you want to speak with someone in your house, you just press a button on your mobile phone. The Pluto system turns on all the tv's and stereo's, and makes a giant conference call in the house--joining in all the tv's--and calls you. This allows you to speak with anybody in your home from a remote location.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="arm" id="arm"></a>Auto arm/disarming of the alarm--saves you hassle and worry (patent pending)</strong><br>
      Because Pluto is able to distinctly recognize each family member, Pluto can automatically turn the alarm off and unlock the door when it detects you approaching the house, and can automatically arm when everyone has left, so you don't have to worry about forgetting to turn the alarm on. #How does Pluto know what room each family member is in?</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="mark" id="mark"></a>Mark rooms as off-limits to anyone but authorized persons (patent pending)</strong><br>
      Because Pluto is able to recognize each family member, you can easily tell Pluto that only certain people are allows in certain rooms when the security is in 'armed at home' mode. The authorized people can come and go from those rooms as they please. Nothing will happen, and they don't need to touch the alarm--it's completely automatic.</p>
      <p>If somebody who is not authorized tries to enter the room, you will be notified on your mobile phone, with a live video feed, and you can press 1 button to speak to that person, or to disarm the system so he can stay in the room, or sound the alarm.</p>
      <p>Before Pluto, if you had a large house and staff and wanted to designate certain rooms as off-limits, you would have to install a separate alarm zone, with a separate keypad, and manually turn the alarm on and off each time you went into the room. It is such a hassle that most people never bothered, and just lived with it. But now Pluto offers you an effortless solution. #How does Pluto know what room each family member is in?</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="accept" id="accept"></a>Accept deliveries and let people in when you're not at home (patent pending)</strong><br>
      Don't ever sit around waiting for a delivery again! Pluto will automatically notify you on your mobile phone when someone rings the doorbell, and show you a live video. You can press a button to unlock the door, talk to the person, watch him leave and lock up again.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="baby" id="baby"></a>Special baby sitter mode to protect your children (patent pending)</strong><br>
      Just tell Pluto if you leave the children at home with a baby sitter. Pluto will notify you whenever someone comes and goes from the house, and show you a picture so you can be sure there are no unauthorized visitors. Of course you can also push a button on your phone to turn on the surveillance cameras and check what's happening at any time. If you wish, Pluto can even automatically keep a video archive of everything that happens in your home. You just need to Pluto when to do it (all the time, only when you're away, and so on), and what cameras you want monitored.</p>
      <p>Pluto security is like nothing you have seen before.<br>
