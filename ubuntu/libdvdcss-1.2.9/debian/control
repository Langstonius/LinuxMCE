Description: Library for accessing DVDs like block device usind deCSS if needed
 libdvdcss is a simple library designed for accessing DVDs like a block device
 without having to bother about the decryption. The important features are:
  * Portability. Currently supported platforms are GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
    OpenBSD, BSD/OS, BeOS, Windows 95/98, Windows NT/2000, MacOS X, Solaris,
    and HP-UX.
  * Simplicity. There are currently 7 functions in the API, and we intend to
    keep this number low.
  * Freedom. libdvdcss is released under the General Public License, ensuring
    it will stay free, and used only for free software products.
  * Just better. Unlike most similar projects, libdvdcss doesn't require the
    region of your drive to be set.
 .
 This package contains the libdvdcss2 runtime library.
