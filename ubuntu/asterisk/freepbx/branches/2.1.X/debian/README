The package freepbx-admin comes with basic administration options. You can also
install the package "freepbx-modules", which is a virtual package which will install 
several other packages.

By default freepbx installs (depends) on apache and mysql, however, you can also
use it with apache2, or even mathopd.

Examples:
    apt-get install freepbx-apache2-mysql  freepbx-admin
    apt-get install freepbx-mathopd-mysql  freepbx-admin
    apt-get install freepbx-mathopd-sqlite freepbx-admin

The sqlite support is not fully functional, and besides the core module
(found on the admin package) is not ganrateed to work. There is work been
done to use sqlite2 on freePBX trunk.
