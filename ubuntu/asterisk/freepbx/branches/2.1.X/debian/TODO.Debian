* more testing 
* finish the support for sqlite (migrate to sqlite3...?)
* test other http servers, mathopd is supported, but new httpd servers are welcomed
* find a more generic way of dialing with httpd servers and sql servers
* find a way to remove the www-data from the group asterisk  (ari is the problem right now)
