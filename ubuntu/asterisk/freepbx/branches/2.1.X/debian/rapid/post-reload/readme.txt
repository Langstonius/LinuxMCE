This directory is used to add scripts which will be exectued
after the user presses the "in your face" red button in FreePBX.

The files much be executable and called "S00-myscript" -

"00" may be replaced by any 2 digit numbers
"myscript" is your script name

The scripts will be executed in alphnumeric order. Very similar to SYSV init scripts.
