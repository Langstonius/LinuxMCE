> 
     The xine engine is a free media player engine. It comes in the form of
     a shared libarary and is typically used by media player frontends
     and other multimedia applications for playback of multimedia streams
     such as movies, radio/tv network streams, DVDs, VCDs.
    </P
><P
>     Since there are several frontends for the xine library available,
     this document has a problem when it comes to examples.
     The two most common frontends xine-ui and gxine are mixed in command
     line examples throughout this FAQ. When you use a different
     frontend, some of these will not work for you. The filename of
     the config file also varies amongst frontends. If you get confused,
     I recommend you try with one of xine-ui or gxine.

     that you haven't just been a bit too lazy to read through all of this
     text. ;-). Also check out the documentation specific to
     the frontend (e.g. <B

     Please provide some info about your setup so people have a chance to
     help you, e.g. include information about your audio/video hardware
     and drivers you use, operating system, cpu type and some console
     output/any error messages. Also include command line parameters you
     have specified and information about the type of stream you're
     trying to play back. Also very important is the version of xine
     you're using and information about any additional plugins you
     may have installed on your system.

>     As long as people know what you are talking about, you are free to
     pronounce it the way you like, but the official pronounciation is
     [ksi:n], like the name "Maxine" with the "Ma" removed.

><P
>     Some time ago xine just became too complex to be just one big program.
     Therefore it was split into two major parts.
    </P
><P
>     xine-lib is simply speaking the engine of xine. It contains all basic plugins
     and is necessary to run anything that relies on xine. (This is the part that
     is covered in this FAQ.)
    </P
><P
>     Then there are frontends - applications that use xine. The most
     common frontend is that of a media player. There are currently
     two frontends being developed in the xine project, xine-ui (skinned
     dvd-player style frontend directly based on xlib) and gxine,
     a desktop media-player style frontend using the standard gtk widget set
     and comes with a mozilla browser plugin.
     External projects like kaffeine, sinek and totem develop additional frontends.
     In the future you will likely see more and different types of applications
     being developed which will use the xine engine for video processing
     and other multimedia purposes.
    </P
><P
>     If you simply want a media/dvd player, you'll need to install xine-lib
     first and then choose and install a player frontend like xine-ui or gxine.
    </P

    </P
><P
>     Generate your patch using either <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cvs diff -u &gt;
     my.patch</B
> or <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hg diff &gt; my.patch</B
> (as
     appropriate). Make sure that your message subject briefly describes the
     patch; your message body should contain a longer description of the
     patch. Your patch should be applicable using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>patch -p0 -i
     my.patch</B
> or, preferably, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>patch -p1 -i
     my.patch</B
> from the top-level directory in the source tree
     (i.e. where configure.ac is) - this is fairly important for our
     Mercurial-based repositories since it makes importing your patch that
     much easier (hg import defaults to -p1).
    </P
><P
>     Alternatively, if you've been hacking away at a module which is
     maintained using mercurial, you can make them available as diffs - use
     <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

     use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hg bundle</B

CLASS="COMMAND"
>hg help export</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hg help
     bundle</B
> for more details) - or via HTTP by using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hg
     serve</B
>. In the latter case, you'll need to post a URL from
     which a developer can pull the changes.

     that patched gcc versions may break parts of xine and are therefore 
     not supported by the xine project.
    </P
><P
>     Furthermore you'll have to use GNU make to compile xine. On most GNU/Linux
     systems "make" is GNU make - on other platforms use "gmake" instead.
     Also, zlib is required (including the appropriate header files, which are
     often found in a package called zlib-devel or similar.)
    </P
><P
>     If you want to compile xine from CVS, you'll need to have the autobuild tools
     installed (automake, autoconf and libtool - in recent versions).
    </P
><P
>     Frontends might need additional libraries, e.g. for gxine you'll need to have
     GTK2 installed. Make sure you have not only the shared libraries themselves
     but also the header files (often packaged seperately as so-called -dev packages)
     on your system.
    </P
><P
>     Some plugins that come with the xine engine need additional libraries (otherwise
     they will not be built). For example, libogg and libvorbis (plus their include files)
     are needed for ogg/vorbis support. Most notably, if you want to see any video
     on your X11 desktop (and that's what you're here for, isn't it?), you need the
     X developer packages as well.
    </P

      non-locked DVD with full menu navigation support. No external
      plugins are required anymore here.
     </P
><P
>      To get DVD playback working, first make sure you have
      a symlink <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/dvd</TT
> pointing to your
      DVD device on your system. For example, if your DVD drive
      is the master ide drive on the second IDE channel,
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/dvd</TT
> should point to
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdc</TT
>. Please note that if you
      are using the ide-scsi emulation on your system, it is
      likely that your DVD drive got mapped to a scsi device
      node even though it is an ide drive. In that case first
      check out you boot/kernel logs (or run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>cdrecord -scanbus</B
>)
      to find out which device it got mapped to and set the
      symlink accordingly (should be something like <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/scd0</TT
>,
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/scd1</TT
>, ... in that case).
      Also make sure you (as a user) have sufficient (read and write) permissions
      on your DVD drive. This could mean you either have to change the device
      permissions or add your user to a special group 
      (e.g. <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>addgroup cdrom username</B
>),
      depending on your setup and/or distribution.
     </P
><P
>      It is highly recommended to switch DMA mode on for your DVD drive
      (without it even very recent machines will have trouble producing
      smooth video output). Use a command like
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hdparm -d 1 &lt;device&gt;</B
>
      on your DVD device. Please note that even if you're using ide-scsi
      you will have to set the dma flag on the ide device node (e.g. 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/hdc</TT
>), not the mapped <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/dev/scd</TT
>
      scsi device.
     </P
><P
>      To be able to play back encrypted DVDs you need to have
      libdvdcss installed on your system (please check if this is legal where
      you live). If you do not understand what the term "encrypted DVD" means
      here: As a rule of thumb, every DVD you have to pay money for is most
      likely encrypted.
     </P
><P
>      To make matters worse, apart from encryption, there is another obstacle
      to take: the region code. The DVD authorities decided to divide the world
      into eight geographical regions. Have a look at
      <A
HREF="http://www.dvdforum.gr.jp/RegionMap.pdf"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.dvdforum.gr.jp/RegionMap.pdf</A
>
      if you want to know which number has been assigned to your country. It is
      now their idea, that you shall only play DVDs, which have been produced
      for your region. If you take a DVD off the shelf in your local store,
      you should find a little globe-like icon which shows the region code the
      disc is for.
     </P
><P
>      Newer (post-2000) DVD drives (so-called RPC-2 drives) check the DVD
      region, which means they'll prevent you from playing back DVDs that have
      a different region code from what the drive is set up for. Some drives
      come with a factory setting of region 0 so they can play back
      any DVD until a region code is set. Others refuse to play any DVD at all
      until they are told a region. The easiest way to handle this is to use
      the regionset utility from

      to start dvd playback. Some frontend also offer so-called autoplay
      buttons or menu entries that start dvd playback immediately.

        will not try to cache the DVDs you play. This would not be useful,

      The driver package contains documentation on how to install it. 
      Besides that I'd like to add the following notes.
     </P
><P
>      In order to compile and install these drivers, you need a valid kernel

      configuration files can be found in 
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux/configs</TT
>.
      After you've located the correct config file for your kernel,
      you need to copy it to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/src/linux/.config</TT
>
      For example, when you run the 2.4.18-i686 kernel do :
      <TABLE

      Make sure that the emu10k1 module that is currently installed is 
      not loaded. To unload the modules:

      If this mentions that the device is busy, some program is 
      using the driver. Some example could be a mixer application 
      or sound daemon like artsd. You'll need to close down the 
      applications before continuing.
      At success it should print something like:
      <TABLE

      Run make in the directory where you unpacked the driver and follow the
