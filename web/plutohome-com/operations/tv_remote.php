        Comparisson of Pluto TV vs. one of the best home automation systems   <br>
       <br>
Below is an actual screen-shot from one of the latest, high-end home automation systems. This is one of the best products of it's kind, sold worldwide by a major consumer electronics company.</p>
      <p>If you do an internet search on: &quot;Wife Acceptance Factor&quot; tablet<br>
        you will quickly learn of a common complaint with this and all such products.</p>
      <p>The screen looks great. The product is gorgeous. But how practical is it? How easy is it to use? Like every &quot;smart home&quot; product on the market this is sending infrared codes to control your existing a/v equipment, just like any universal remote. This means the tablet can only show you the buttons--not the actual information. If you bring up the program guide, the guide appears on the tv, just like it would with the manufacturer's remote. The only thing you see on the tablet are the same buttons that were on the original remote. There is no way around this--the infrared communication is 1 way. The tablet does not know what channel you are on, or what is playing at 8:00. The screen does not change depending on what you are doing. All the tablet can do is show all buttons on the original remote and send the same infrared codes. </p>

			<br>
       <p> This means that if you want to change channels or bring up the program guide, for example, you have to look at the tv to see where your pointer is, then look at the tablet to find the up/down buttons to move it, then look back at the tv to see where you are now, then back at the tablet to move more, and so on. That's what the industry means by WAF--or &quot;Wife Acceptance Factor&quot;. There's a tech-loving, gadget fanatic in the house who loves these gorgeous, color tablets. But, the other family members complain that if the tablet is just going to show the same buttons on the remote that was included for free, the free remote with physical buttons is much easier to use. After all you can feel the buttons. So you can just keep your eye on the screen while your thumb rests on the up/down buttons. The tablet is a flat screen, so you have to look at the tv, and then look at the tablet to find the right button.<br>
        <br>
        Frankly, we agree with the &quot;wife&quot; in this case. The whole point of a touch-screen tablet is that you see what you want on the tablet, and touch it directly on the tablet. But no product on the market does that except Pluto, because only Pluto has the media functions built-in.</p>
      <p>With Pluto, you press only the TV button. Because Pluto knows each family member's favorite shows and channels, it automatically tunes to whatever is your favorite most show that is on at that time, in this case 'Larry King'. Most of the time you will never need to touch a single button. In case this wasn't the show you wanted, Pluto automatically found your #2 and #3 choices (in this case 'The Simpsons' and 'Fear Factor') and put preview windows right there on the tablet. If you want one of those instead, just touch the video windows on the tablet--you'll never even need the guide. </p>
      <p><center><a href="javascript:open_popup('operations/poza14.html','532','465')"><img src="images/img%20how%20to/05/05_03_m.jpg" width="141" height="112" border="0"></a> <a href="javascript:open_popup('operations/poza12.html','532','465')"><img src="images/img%20how%20to/05/01_m.jpg" width="141" height="112" border="0"></a>
      </center></p>
      <p>For those rare occasions where Pluto didn't anticipate your wishes automatically, you can channel surf on the tablet, and you see on the tablet what channel you're on, so you don't need to look at the screen. If you want to bring up the program guide, just touch 'guide', and .... <br>
        You guessed it. We show you the guide right there on the tablet. The tablet has a thumb dial you use to scroll the program guide and you just touch the show you want. This way you can search the program guide while somebody else is watching tv. Finally, a touch-screen tablet that works like a touch-screen is supposed to work!</p>
      <p>Similarly, if you find a show you want to record, with any other home automation system your menu of choices appears on the tv, and you have the same problem of using the arrows on the tablet to navigate a menu on the tv.</p>
      <p>As you would expect, Pluto always puts your menu right there on the tablet.<br>
  Pluto's on-tablet program guide works worldwide. Here is the European Astra Satellite. (click on the lower left thumbnail) <br>
  When you select a show that starts at a future time, Pluto gives you clear choices for how to handle it. You can even select whether to save this as 'public' or 'private'. Private means only the person recording it can watch it again, in this case Marco. Public means anyone in the family can watch it.</p>
      <p>Similarly, if you go to watch a DVD, Pluto does not make you touch up/down arrows on the tablet to navigate the menu on the tv, like home automation systems do. Pluto puts the dvd menu right on the Orbiter so you can touch your selection.</p>
