    &bull; Speech synthesis (ie verbal announcements, countdown timers, etc.)<br>
    &bull; Specify how each sensor should behave in each mode: trigger a security breach, sound a warning in the house, or make an announcement (entertaining mode, for example, can announce when people come through the door so you can greet your guests)<br>

    &bull; Video archive accessible via the internet<br>
