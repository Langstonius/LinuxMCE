        The low-cost Core + Media Director Hybrid <br>
        <br>
For a limited time we are also offering a specially modified Media Director that has been upgraded so that it has a mini-Core built-in. It has all the same features and benefits, and will still do everything that a full Pluto Core and a Pluto Media Director, and still provides the 'big 5'. There are differences, though.</p>
      <p>It is not a commercial server--we took the PC components that would normally run Windows, and put the Pluto Core software there instead. This means that it cannot run Windows, and also that it does not have the power to run multiple media directors, like the full Core. The hybrid includes a Pluto Media Director, plus a Pentium 4 computer that is working as the Core. When you compare the specs to the full Core, you'll see the huge difference--the full Core is running on multiple Intel Xeon processors with a massive RAID array. The hybrid is only able to work as a stand-alone system, by itself, connected directly to one tv/entertainment center. If you want multiple media directors, you will need a Pluto Core. Also, the hybrid does not have a RAID array--it uses a normal PC hard drive. So, like a PC, there is the risk that the hard drive could crash and you could lose data. Also, it does not have the expandability of the Pluto Core. It can only handle 4 phone lines, for example, whereas a Pluto Core can handle 100. And the hard drive has a capacity of 200 GB. That is the largest available for a PC right now, and more than you will find in today's crop of media PC's, however, it is nowhere near the 10,000 GB capacity of the Core's RAID array.</p>
      <p>You will still enjoy all the benefits Pluto offers. What's more, when you later want to upgrade to a full Pluto system, the hybrid will automatically turn into a normal Pluto Media Director--remember all Pluto devices are self-configuring! Even the Pentium 4 computer inside will turn back into a Windows PC so that in the end it is identical to a normal Media Director. And, when you buy a full Pluto Core, we will credit the difference in price between the Hybrid and a normal Pluto Media Director, so it will not cost you 1 penny extra to start with a hybrid and later upgrade to a full Pluto system.<br>
                  <br>
          1. The first video source is for an external tuner, like a satellite or cable box, connected with s-video or composite. The 2nd video source can be over the air or cable using the media director's internal tuner, or a second external tuner box connected via the RF output.</p>
      <p>2. Optical spdif available with an adapter</p>
      <p>3. Additional RS232 ports available on the Interface Module <br>
        back panel connections </p>
