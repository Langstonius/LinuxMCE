      You are going to love this!  What other remote lets you control everything in the house with one thumb, is so simple you can learn all there is to know in about 5 minutes?  And makes phone calls too.</p>
<p><strong>Pluto main menu on the mobile phone</strong> (click on the upper left thumbnail)<br>      
When you're in the house, the phone uses Bluetooth. When you leave, it switches to the cellular data network, so you can control your house from anywhere in the world you have cellular service.</p>
      <p>When you're home, the lower left part of the screen always shows you what room you are in, and the menu shows you whatever activities apply to that room. You tell Pluto through a simple web page what you want to be able to do in each room. It usually takes about an hour when you first get your Pluto system to make the choices for all the rooms in the house, and from then on everything is 1 button push away. Like 'leave house', which, for this homeowner, only appears when he's near the door, and turns off all the lights, tv's and stereos in the whole house, lowers the climate system, opens the garage door, and switches the alarm system to armed. Or 'come home', which shuts off the alarm, turns on the lights in the foyer and living room, puts on some background music, and plays any voice mail messages through the nearest tv. If you want to control a room other than the one you are in, just press the button under the room, and you can pick from all the rooms in the house. That way you can turn off the lights in the bedroom, for example, even if you're in the living room. <br>
        The green 'ok' button, always gets the lights in whatever you're in, toggling between on and off. And, for each room you can tell Pluto what 'on' and 'off' means--it doesn't have to be all lights on full or off completely.</p>
      <p>The buttons 1-5 are each of your main categories. So, if you press '1-lights' it lists all the lighting and mood scenes for that room, including drapes &amp; blinds. '2-media' lists all your media choices, '3-climate' climate options, including pool, jacuzzi and sprinklers. '4-telecom' sets your status and shows voice messages. '5-security' set thes alarm mode and also shows surveillance cameras directly on the phone, as well as lock/unlock any doors, and broadcast your voice through parts of the house.</p>
      <p><center><a href="javascript:open_popup('operations/poza2.html','532','465')"><img src="images/img%20how%20to/02/02_mainmenu_m.jpg" width="141" height="112" border="0"></a> <a href="javascript:open_popup('operations/poza3.html','532','465')"><img src="images/img%20how%20to/02/02_dvd_1_m.jpg" width="141" height="112" border="0"></a> <a href="javascript:open_popup('operations/poza4.html','532','465')"><img src="images/img%20how%20to/02/02_dvd_2_m.jpg" width="141" height="112" border="0"></a></center></p>
      <p>Each of those, 1-5, can be put in follow mode. Just hold the button down for 1 second to toggle the red 'F' on or off. When 'Lights' follow me is on, the lights will automatically come on to your preferred setting when you enter a room, and if nobody else is in the room, shut off when you leave. The 'Media' follow me means that whatever media you are watching or listening to (movies, music, tv) will follow you as you move around the house. If you start watching a DVD movie, for example, and put the 'Media' in follow me mode, as you leave one room that tv will shut off, and as you enter another that tv will come on and the movie will continue where it left off. Of course if you enter a room and another family member is already in there watching something else, your media will not start until he leaves or turns his media off.</p>
      <p>With 'Climate' follow me when you enter a room the climate will adjust to your preferred setting, and switch off when you leave. Again, 'off' doesn't necessarily mean off completely--you can tell Pluto what you mean by 'on' and 'off'. When you put the 'Phone' in follow-me mode, your phone calls will always ring on the extension in whatever room you're in. And, when you put 'Security' in follow me mode, then whenever you enter a room those sensors will automatically be bypassed. This can be very practical if you have staff, for example, and want certain rooms to be 'off limits'. All you do is tell Pluto that you want those sensors normally armed. Then you can come and go--no problem. But if someone else enters, your mobile phone will beep--no matter where in the world you are--and show you a live video and give you the option of speaking to the person in the room, or shutting the alarm off. <br>
<p>		  The round dial in the middle is 'smart' and changes it's function based on what you're doing.  For example, while watching tv or a dvd, it does skip up/down and fast forward/rewind, and push the middle for pause.  But as soon as a dvd menu appears on the screen (click on the upper middle and right thumbnail), the Pluto Media Director instantly changes the display, pipes the menu directly to the phone (yes, you are watching the live dvd menu on the phone), and the dial becomes the normal up/down/left/right and enter.
</p>
      <p>It's so comfortable to have one little dial that always works consistently, just the way you'd expect no matter the brand or type of device. </p>
      <p><strong>Your media choices</strong> (click on the lower left thumbnail)<br>
        Buttons 1 &amp; 5 turn the tv/radio in that room on, checks the program guide to see what's on, and automatically tunes to your favorite show or channel. 2,3,4,7,8 and 0 bring up a list of media. Just type on the phone like you normally do to find a contact, and hit 'enter' when you found the one you want. 9 lets you make a cd or dvd. And * shows all your favorite programs and web sites. Hit 1 button to bring a web site or program up on the nearest tv. * also gives you the option of turning the Media Director into a normal Windows PC and back again. The red 'off' button always shuts off whatever you're doing</p>
      <p><center><a href="javascript:open_popup('operations/poza5.html','532','465')"><img src="images/img%20how%20to/02/02_media_m.jpg" width="141" height="112" border="0"> <img src="images/img%20how%20to/02/02_alert_m.jpg" width="141" height="112" border="0"></a> <a href="javascript:open_popup('operations/poza7.html','532','465')"><img src="images/img%20how%20to/02/02_tv_m.jpg" width="141" height="112" border="0"></a>
      </center></p>
      
      <p><strong>Surveillance camera</strong> (click on the lower middle thumbnail)<br>
        Whenever someone rings the door or trips the alarm, your phone automatically shows you the video from the closest camera. If it points near a door that has a remote lock/unlock bolt, you can open the door. This lets you accept deliveries from even when you're not home. The 'speak' button turns on the nearby tv's and stereo's and pipes your voice through so you can talk with whoever is there. <br>
        <br>
			<p><strong>TV remote</strong> (click on the lower right thumbnail)<br>
        Press 'all opts' to see all advanced options, (to order pay per view, for example). You can also view the program guide on the phone. '5' - security options<br>
      1-6 are the six alarm modes. 7 turns on 'baby sitter mode', so you can leave the house and your phone will beep when someone comes or goes from the house, and show you a picture. 8 and higher are shortcuts to your surveillance cameras (see below). Note that this works no matter where you are in the world--you can always view your cameras, and control your alarm</p>
      That's all there is to it. You just learned everything you need to know to control the whole Pluto system.</p></td>
