    <td class="insidetable"><p><strong><strong><a name="can" id="can"></a></strong>Can Pluto run wireless? <br>
          <br>
          </strong>The Pluto Orbiters and your mobile phones are, of course, wireless. You can carry them around the house. However, the Media Directors need to be connected to the Core with a cat 5 cable. Remember, the Core is serving all your media, and movies in particular require a lot of bandwidth, or data transfer. Wireless communication does not presently come even remotely close to offering the speed and reliability needed to watch stream movies, for example.</p>
      <p>This paragraph is of interest to tech-savvy readers only: You may be thinking that 802.11g boasts a transfer rate of 54 mbps, and a DVD movie is less than 10. Yes, that is true. However, when the manufacturers of wi-fi devices rate their speeds, they are rating the maximum speed when the 2 wi-fi devices are within a couple feet of each other. Once you move the devices across the room the speed drops dramatically. And once the devices are in separate rooms with a wall between, the actual speed is only a fraction of the rated speed, and it is definitely not fast enough to stream a movie. What's more, with wi-fi all the devices on the network are sharing the same bandwidth--that is the same air waves. So the speed drops even more when you have a laptop running the internet, and the Pluto Orbiters going, and so on. Whereas with a hardwired network, each Media Director will typically be on it's own 'leg', meaning that it will not be sharing bandwidth with the other Media Directors. This is because the Core and your central switch will both be Gigabit Ethernet. So the Core will be feeding the switch at 1,000 mbps, and then each run to each Media Director will be 100 or 1,000 mbps depending on whether your home has cat 5 or cat 5e/6 cabling.</p>
      <p><strong><strong><a name="what" id="what"></a></strong>What if my home doesn't have cat 5? </strong></p>
      <p>Fortunately, the cabling Pluto requires, cat 5, is a good investment even without the Pluto system. Cat 5 is the standard cable used for all home networks, nearly all phone systems, and all sorts of other devices in the house. That is why most new homes have cat 5 in them already. Studies have been done that prove that having cat 5 cabling in your home, making it a 'wired home', substantially increases the value. As the internet becomes even more and more common, a 'wired home' becomes even more essential, since that same cat 5 cabling is what also allows the whole family to share 1 internet connection.</p>
      <p>Also, cat 5 cabling is comparably easy to install. If your home has the old style phone wiring (known as cat 3), it is sometimes even possible to use the old wiring to pull new wiring through the walls because cat 5 is close to the same size as cat 3. Your Pluto sales rep can arrange for a local cabling contractor to do the work for you, and we can even get competitive bids for you, and, if you wish, we will supervise the process to be sure it's done right.</p>
      <p>The cost will vary depending on the complexity of the job. If you just want some cable run along the baseboard or the edge of the carpet, that's very inexpensive. Drilling a small hole in the floor and running the cable through the basement or along the outside of the house is also cheap. Of course if the cabling needs to be fed through the walls it can be a bigger project, especially in multi-story buildings or solid structures, like old, brick houses. We'll help you decide the best solution, and find you a good deal. And remember, even if you move and take the Pluto system with you, just having a 'wired house' will help your resale value and offset the cost of the cabling.<br>
          <br>
          <strong><strong><a name="what_is" id="what_is"></a></strong>What is proper cat5 cabling? </strong><br>
          <br>
          There are general rules for installing cat 5 cabling. For example, the cable cannot be run in a conduit with or parallel to your power lines. The power lines will generate interface and cause noise on the cable, making it unusable as an Ethernet network, and resulting in bad sound quality when used for telephone calls. These rules are common knowledge, and legitimate contractors and electricians will follow them. Further, cat 5 cabling is not particularly 'delicate'--it will still run fine even if the rules are &quot;stretched&quot; here and there.</p>
      <p>However, if whoever ran the wiring did an unacceptable job, driving a nail through the cable, or running it with the power lines, this is, obviously, something that Pluto cannot be responsible for. If you choose to have professional installation, the installer will bring with him the standard tools used in the industry to measure the line quality. These are the same tools used by your phone company, cable tv company and satellite provider when they setup high-speed internet in your home.</p>
