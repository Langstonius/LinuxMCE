Fiire is the most advanced solution for home automation and media control available on the shelves right now, which does everything that the $100,000+ solutions from Crestron, Control 4, AMX, Kaleidescape, LifeWare and Escient do.<br>
See next a short description of Fiire.

<B>Enjoy media</B><br>
From now on you'll find media more existing!<br>
With Fiire you can watch TV (cable box or satellite) and record your favorite shows, watch a DVD or listen a CD; copy a DVD or CD to your Fiire Engine; watch or listen stored media; play the same media in multiple rooms simultaneously; catalog media with attributes; search media for attributes; make your media follow you in the house, or make announcements.
<p>
<B>Throw all remotes</B><br>
You don't need more than one remote from now on. Fiire is controlling everything and allows you to use a single remote for turning all TV's on, stream media to whole house, turn the Jacuzzi on when heading to your house from work. You can do all these, and more, by just using the mobile phone, the gyro remote, any IR remote that you're comfortable with, or a web tablet. So, you can throw away all your remotes and use only one device, the one that you love most.

<p>
<B>Control regular devices</B><br>
You can control light switches, brightness sensors, any IR climate devices, arm or disarm security panels; surveillance cameras, regular A/V devices with IR or RS232, regular phones or VOIP phones, etc.
