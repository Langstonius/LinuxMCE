              <td><p>The manufacturing, order fulfillment, and warranty repairs for Fiire  products are provided by Polywell Computers, of San Francisco.&nbsp; Polywell is a highly  respected manufacturer that has been delivering millions of OEM and retail direct  systems for over 20 years, and whose products are regarded as high quality and have  received numerous awards, such as PC World's Best Buy, PC Magazine-Editor's  Choice, and Infoworld-Buyers' Assurance Seals.</p>
                <p>Fiire provides the tech support, customer call center, and web site  promotion. &nbsp;Fiire is unique in many ways.&nbsp; First, most tech companies  outsource the support to low cost call centers with employees that have only  minimal training.&nbsp; Fiire instead has hired actual LinuxMCE gurus and enthusiasts  from all over the world who typically work from home and know LinuxMCE inside  out.&nbsp; So when you call Fiire support, you&rsquo;re reaching someone who  knows what they&rsquo;re talking about.&nbsp; And we closely monitor the  feedback callers leave to be sure each support rep provides only the best  support.&nbsp; Also, instead of spending money on marketing, Fiire gives back  to its customers as a referral fee the 15% that would typically be used to  market a product.&nbsp; Fiire also aggressively supports the open source  movement by providing free hardware and cash bonuses for developers who make contributions.</p>
                <p>Fiire is privately held, and can be reached by calling: (877) on-fiire  or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@fiire.com">info@fiire.com</a></p>
              <p>Warranty and support issues should first be addressed to Fiire who will  provide an RMA number, however, Polywell, as the original manufacturer,  provides the warranty and can be reached at: <a href="http://www.polywell.com/us/contact.asp">http://www.polywell.com/us/contact.asp</a></p></td>
