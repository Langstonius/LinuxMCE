                <p>The FiireChief is controls both the FiireEngine and FiireStation using  RF wireless, and has a range of approx. 50&rsquo;.&nbsp; It is omni-directional  and does not require line of site like an infrared remote.&nbsp; The FiireChief  has all the traditional, legacy remote control buttons, as well as 3  specialized &lsquo;gyro&rsquo; buttons in the middle that let you control every  function using only those 3 buttons and gestural movements.&nbsp; It also has a  built-in &lsquo;follow-me&rsquo; feature.&nbsp; You can start media in one  room, and when you want to move to another room, just take the remote with you  and press &lsquo;Follow-me&rsquo;.&nbsp; Fiire is able to track each remote  individually, so whatever media you started with that remote will follow that  remote around the house.&nbsp; Your movies, TV and music effortlessly follow  you as you move from room to room.&nbsp; And whenever you enter a room, the FiireChief  instantly and automatically switches to control the devices in that room.&nbsp;  So when you&rsquo;re in the living room, the volume button ,controls the volume  on the tv in the living room.&nbsp; Take the remote into the bedroom, and the volume  button controls whatever tv is in the bedroom, whether or not it is the same  brand as the one in the living room.&nbsp; The FiireChief is the only remote  control you will need for every room in the home, and you don&rsquo;t need to  worry about which remote goes with room since any remote can work in any room.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the FiireChief has a universal i/r remote built-in with  both pre-stored codes and learning.&nbsp; You can program up to 3 i/r devices  to control with the &lsquo;tv&rsquo;, &lsquo;aux&rsquo;, and &lsquo;cab/sat&rsquo;  buttons at the top.&nbsp; In those modes, it acts like a normal, universal i/r  remote.</p>
                <p>The FiireChief includes one USB dongle which you connect to a Fiire Engine,  Fiire Station, or other LinuxMCE PC.</p></td>
