              <td><p>The FiireEngine and FiireStation are available with the optional SureFiire  guarantee, or as a do-it-yourself product.&nbsp; With the SureFiire guarantee, we  promise your unconditional total satisfaction and that your Fiire system will  work with and control your existing legacy devices, even if there are no  drivers for them in LinuxMCE.&nbsp; &nbsp;We will write the drivers and make your  product will work (details below).&nbsp; So, if you have a TV you want to  control and LinuxMCE doesn&rsquo;t come with the I/R codes, that&rsquo;s no  problem.&nbsp; Give us the model number, and we&rsquo;ll do all the legwork to  get the I/R codes and update your system.&nbsp; If you have an alarm panel that  has a serial port, but there&rsquo;s no support in LinuxMCE for it, no  problem.&nbsp; We will contact the manufacturer, get the protocol from them,  write the drivers, and update your system.&nbsp; At no extra cost to you.&nbsp;  If you&rsquo;re having trouble with some media files, or getting your TV tuner  to work, or any other such issue, it&rsquo;s covered under the SureFiire  guarantee.&nbsp; Even if you just want us to help you setup some custom  lighting scenes, it&rsquo;s covered.&nbsp; You get white gloves hand-holding  with 24/7 tech support via phone or chat.&nbsp; All Fiire systems come with a  remote assistance feature, so anytime you need help, you contact us, chose the &lsquo;remote  assistance&rsquo; option from the main menu, and your Fiire system will contact  our server and give your support rep remote temporary access to your admin  panel and logs until you choose the &lsquo;stop remote assistance&rsquo;  option, at which time the system locks down again and is inaccessible by us.</p>
                <p>If you&rsquo;re a do-it-yourselfer and have already done your homework and  know that LinuxMCE is right for you and are comfortable with the online support  tools, then you can skip the SureFiire guarantee and the cost of your Fiire  system is about the same as you would pay at any discount computer shop.</p>
                <p>Details of the SureFiire guarantee:</p>
                <p>With each FiireEngine and FiireStation you purchase with the SureFiire  guarantee, we agree to add support to LinuxMCE for the following devices:</p>
                <p>TV, Receiver, VCR, DVD Player, or other I/R remote-controlled a/v device:  We will find the i/r codes for you and update your system.&nbsp; In rare cases  where we are unable to locate i/r codes, we will guide you through the learning  process over the phone.&nbsp; You must have a compatible i/r transmitter with  your system, of course.&nbsp; Limit 2 devices for each FiireEngine or  FiireStation.</p>
                <p>TV, Receiver, VCR, DVD Player or other a/v gear with a serial port, USB  port, or Ethernet port:&nbsp; We will contact the manufacturer to get the communication  protocol and add support.&nbsp; Serial device control requires a USB-&gt;Serial  control dongle.&nbsp; Limit 2 devices for each FiireEngine or FiireStation.</p>
                <p>USB WebCams: We will add plug and play drivers within LinuxMCE,  provided the camera is supported by the Linux kernel.&nbsp; *</p>
                <p>TV Tuners and Capture Boards: We will add plug and play drivers within  LinuxMCE and get them working with LinuxMCE&rsquo;s PVR, provided the hardware  is supported by the Linux kernel.&nbsp; *</p>
                <p>Lighting control, climate control, alarm panel, pool control and  sprinkler control: We will add plug and play drivers within LinuxMCE, and  confirm the device works seamlessly within LinuxMCE.&nbsp; The device being  controlled must support some mechanism of control that LinuxMCE can talk to,  such as RS-232 serial port, USB or Ethernet.</p>
                <p>VOIP Phone or accessory: We will integrate any device that speaks the SIP  or IAX protocols which are standard in the VOIP industry.</p>
                <p>Other miscellaneous devices, such as intercoms, generic i/o relays,  drapery control, etc.: We will do our best to integrate any of these devices  too provided they have some way of talking to them, such as RS-232 serial port,  USB or Ethernet.&nbsp; If you are not satisfied, we will gladly accept the  Fiire products back and refund your money in full.</p>
                <p>Time limits: The SureFiire guarantee is valid for 60 days after you  receive your Fiire products.&nbsp; At any time during those 60 days you can  request a full refund if you are not totally satisfied.&nbsp; If during the 60  day period you require us to develop new drivers, Fiire will likely extend the SureFiire  guarantee beyond 60 days to allow sufficient time to develop the drivers and  confirm you are satisfied that they work well.&nbsp; This is at Fiire&rsquo;s  option, however, and the SureFiire guarantee period is extended only when your  support rep gives you a confirmation email.&nbsp; Fiire products are  non-returnable after 60 days.</p>
                <p>Warranty: All Fiire products are guaranteed for 90 days from the date  of purchase whether or not you purchase the SureFiire guarantee.&nbsp; If your  Fiire product is defective within the warranty period, you may return it for  repair or replacement at Fiire&rsquo;s sole discretion.&nbsp; The LinuxMCE  software comes with no warrantees or guarantees whatsoever, except as provided  within the optional SureFiire guarantee.</p>
              <p>Restocking fee: If you purchase the SureFiire guarantee you can return  your purchase within 60 days for a full refund provided you first obtain an RMA  number, and return the products in their original packaging and in the original  condition with no damage other than normal wear and tear, and with all the  manuals, accessories.&nbsp; If you do not have the packaging, or the manuals or  accessories, a 15% restocking fee will be charged.&nbsp; If you do not purchase  the SureFiire guarantee, you can return your purchase within 30 days for a full  refund minus the shipping charges and a 15% restocking fee provided you first  obtain an RMA number, and return the products in their original packaging and  in the original condition with no damage other than normal wear and tear, and with  all the manuals, accessories, or minus a 25% if you are missing the packaging,  manuals or accessories.&nbsp; In all cases, Fiire will not accept back damaged  items.&nbsp; All Fiire shipments are insured by the carrier, so damages during  shipment from Fiire to the customer are covered by the carrier&rsquo;s  insurance, and the customer is responsible for shipping items being returned  back to Fiire by a reputable carrier with insurance, such as UPS, Fedex, DHL, Airborne  Express, or the U.S. Postal Service.</p></td>
