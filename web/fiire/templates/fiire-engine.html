                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; LinuxMCE supports 3 variations of the user interface, as shown here: [link]  &nbsp;&nbsp; The FiireStations are designed to be LinuxMCE media stations,  and use special graphics processors and video decoders to provide the highest  quality video playback, and provide alpha blending done in the hardware.&nbsp;  However, the video subsystem in the FiireStation is not available for use in a  standard PC platform.&nbsp; The FiireEngine, however, uses standard PC parts.&nbsp;  At present, for standard PC&rsquo;s, only certain nVidia provides support in  their drivers for LinuxMCE&rsquo;s UI2 with alpha blending.&nbsp; However, the  nVidia drivers have some video artifacts particularly evident with 1080i  content, and the drivers are not fully stable.&nbsp; Therefore, we have  included a Via graphics engine, which, although it does not support alpha  blending, does provide better video quality and is more stable.&nbsp; In the  rooms where you want the full LinuxMCE experience with UI2 and alpha blending,  use one of the FiireStations.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The FiireEngine is intended to be primarily the back-end server,  while the FiireStations are dedicated for media playback.&nbsp; Therefore the  FiireStations have more a/v connections, including component video, and SPDIF  coax and optical for digital audio and surround sound.</p></td>
