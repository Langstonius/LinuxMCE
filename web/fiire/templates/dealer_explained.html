	<p><strong>How dealers and others promote their goods, services and events with Fiire</strong></p>
	<p>Fiire allows any user to list themselves as a dealer that sells products, or a custom installer that can install products the customer buys elsewhere,
	or promote events like open houses which are a great way to sign up new customers and <a href="get-fired.php">get commissions from Fiire</a>.  Users
	can offer multiple services, and in multiple areas.  Fiire does not require any committment or application, and does not do any screening.  Rather, we 
	have a rating system so other users can comment on their experiences with dealers.  It is community-drive, like e-Bay.</p>
	<p>Not everyone who lists themselves as a dealer will sell Fiire equipment, and it's perfectly acceptable for a dealer to instead offer competing solutions.</p>
	<p>If a dealer does wish to resell Fiire equipment, it is easy to do so, and no application is required.  Fiire's products are sold at extremely slim margins,
	so there is not the traditional profit margin for dealers.  However, Fiire does set aside 15% of the purchase price for marketing and promotion, which
	is normally paid out in the form of <a href="get-fired.php">commissions for referring</a> Fiire.  Once a user has purchased one Fiire Engine, and has listed
	himself as a dealer, there will be an option on his "My account" page called "I resell Fiire".  Choose this option and on all future purchases the dealer 
	can purchase Fiire equipment at a 15% discount, instead of having that 15% go to referral fees.  The dealer can then resell the Fiire equipment at any 
	price he sets, and may bundle it with other smart home gear as well as installation services.
	</p>
	<p>Because Fiire provides no screening of dealers, users are encouraged to verify the dealer's credentials and read carefully the reviews left by other users.</p>
