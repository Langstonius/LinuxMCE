This is the README for the ivtv module suite.

---------------- NOTES -----------------
NOTE 1: The ivtv-0.8.x release is for the 2.6.18 kernel. It does NOT compile with
older kernels. If you want to use ivtv on older kernels, then you should use
ivtv-0.4.X, ivtv-0.6.X or ivtv-0.7.X instead. The ivtv-0.4 series provides support
for kernels up to 2.6.15 only. The 0.6 release is for kernel 2.6.16. The 0.7 release
is for kernel 2.6.17. The 0.8 release is unlikely to work with kernels >= 2.6.19,
look at www.ivtvdriver.org for more information by the time such kernels appear.

NOTE 2: MythTV user alert: ivtv-0.8 uses the new official V4L2 API for MPEG
encoders. The old ivtv-specific API has been removed. This means that you need
MythTV-0.20, older versions will not work anymore. 

If you run a 64-bit kernel, then you also need to apply patch misc/MythTV-0.20.diff
over MythTV-0.20: that fixes a 64-bit bug in MythTV.

NOTE 3: When you build your own kernel, make sure you have enabled all modules
in Device Drivers, Multimedia devices, Video Capture Adapters, Encoders and Decoders.
Especially the new 'Conexant CX2341x MPEG encoders' entry.
---------------- NOTES -----------------

The primary goal of the IVTV project is to provide a "clean room" Linux 
Open Source driver implementation for video capture cards based on the 
iCompression iTVC15 or Conexant CX23415/CX23416 MPEG Codec.

The following cards are supported:

Hauppauge WinTV PVR 250
Hauppauge WinTV PVR 350
Hauppauge WinTV PVR-150
Hauppauge WinTV PVR-500
AVerMedia M179
Yuan MPG600/Kuroutoshikou iTVC16-STVLP
Yuan MPG160/Kuroutoshikou iTVC15-STVLP
Yuan PG600/DiamondMM PVR-550 (CX Falcon 2)
Adaptec AVC-2410
Adaptec AVC-2010
Nagase Transgear 5000TV
AOpen VA2000MAX-STN6
Yuan MPG600GR/Kuroutoshikou CX23416GYC-STVLP
I/O Data GV-MVP/RX
I/O Data GV-MVP/RX2E
Gotview PCI DVD (preliminary support only)
Gotview PCI DVD2 Deluxe
Yuan MPC622

A special note regarding the PVR-500: this card basically consists of two
PVR-150 cards on one board but with the following difference: Radio,
Composite video and S-video are only hooked up to the first PVR-150 instance.

The Hauppauge cable set that you can buy for their cards to add an additional
Composite/S-Video input is also supported.

Features:
 * Hardware mpeg2 capture of broadcast video (and sound) via the tuner or
   S-Video/Composite and audio line-in.
 * Hardware mpeg2 capture of FM radio where hardware support exists
 * Supports NTSC, PAL, SECAM with stereo sound
 * Supports SAP and bilingual transmissions.
 * Supports raw VBI (closed captions and teletext).
 * Supports raw YUV and PCM input.

Additional features for the PVR-350 (CX23415 based):
 * Provides hardware mpeg2 playback
 * Provides comprehensive OSD (On Screen Display: ie. graphics overlaying the
   video signal)
 * Provides a framebuffer (allowing X applications to appear on the video
   device)
 * Supports raw YUV output.

Note: the old sourceforge ivtv project is no longer active and will
redirect to ivtvdriver.org. All development now takes place in the
subversion repository on ivtvdriver.org.
