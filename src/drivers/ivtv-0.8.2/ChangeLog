IVTV changes:

0.8.2 stable release
	- Fix handling of corrupt tveeprom.
	- Fix busy wait loop

0.8.1 stable release
	- vbi test tool accepts -d1 as a shortcut for /dev/video1
	- added videodev2.h in utils since distros often are sloppy
	  in updating this file in a new kernel release.
	- some usability improvements to v4l2-ctl. Please note! Some
	  options have new names.
	- workaround VIDIOC_INT_S_REGISTER kernel bug (wrong ioctl value
	  in the v4l2-common.h header, this is fixed in 2.6.19).
	- saa717x fixes for Japanese cards.
	- reported pix format was V4L2_PIX_FMT_UYVY instead of V4L2_PIX_FMT_HM12.
	- added missing VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT ioctl.
	- added new IVTV_IOC_STOP ioctl (thanks to Martin Dauskardt <md001@gmx.de>)
	- added new IVTV_IOC_PAUSE_BLACK ioctl (thanks to Martin Dauskardt <md001@gmx.de>)
	  Similar to IVTV_IOC_PAUSE, but it turns the output black when paused.
	- Fix encoder pause/resume: these two were swapped.
	- Firmware loading has been made more robust
	  Thanks to Robert Hardy <rhardy@webcon.ca>.
	- Firmware loading once again supports ppc.
	- Fix nasty bug when loading the init mpeg file
	  Thanks to Robert Hardy <rhardy@webcon.ca>.
	- Enabling of newi2c support now depends on the presence of an IR-blaster.
	- No longer turn the digitizer off and on when changing channels, this
	  caused the tinny audio!
	- Fix VIDIOC_STREAMOFF support.
	- Detection of Hauppauge cards is now fully based on the tveeprom,
	  PCI IDs are ignored. Other cards still use the PCI ID for detection.
	- The detection of the first or second unit of a PVR500 is now done based
	  on the PCI 'slot' used on the PVR500 card. The first unit has slot 8,
	  the second has slot 9.
	- Added IR-blaster detection, with thanks to Hauppauge's Steven Toth for
	  providing this information.
	- Fix initial PAL/SECAM/NTSC tuner defaults.
	- Fix driver cleanup in case an error occurs.
	- Fix VIDIOC_INT_S_AUDIO_ROUTING ioctl.
	- Ripped out dynamic buffer allocation: it never worked right and gave
	  some people a lot of grief.
	- Make i2c errors (missing i2c devices) more readable.

0.8.0 stable release
	Many API changes as part of the work to merge the driver into the kernel:
	- Removed IVTV_IOC_S/G_DEBUG_LEVEL: use /sys/module/ivtv/parameter/ivtv_debug
	  instead.
	- Removed IVTV_IOC_ZCOUNT, IVTV_IOC_FWAPI, IVTV_IOC_EVENT_SETUP,
	  IVTV_IOC_RELOAD_FW: no longer needed or wanted.
	- Replaced IVTV_IOC_S/G_DECODER_REG, IVTV_IOC_S/G_ENCODER_REG and
	  IVTV_IOC_S/G_ITVC_REG by VIDIOC_INT_S/G_REGISTER.
	- Replaced IVTV_IOC_S_AUDIO_ROUTING by VIDIOC_INT_S_AUDIO_ROUTING.
	- Replaced IVTV_IOC_RESET_IR by VIDIOC_INT_RESET.
	- Removed IVTV_IOC_S_START_DECODE and IVTV_IOC_S_STOP_DECODE: this was
	  experimental code only as far as I can tell. It was certainly pointless
	  code.
	- Replaced IVTV_IOC_S/G_CODEC by the new V4L2 MPEG encoding API.
	- Replaced IVTV_IOC_S/G_VBI_EMBED by the new V4L2 MPEG encoding API.
	- Removed IVTV_IOC_G_DRIVER_INFO and IVTV_IOC_G_STREAM_INFO: the first
	  wasn't very useful, the second is now replaced by the kernel messages
	  that appear when loading the driver and that tell you which device is
	  used for what stream.
	
	Bug fixes:
	- Detect and workaround DMA offsets that can be introduced by
	  a DMA error.
	- Sliced VBI always uses PIO, never DMA.

	Utility changes:
	- Removed test/fwapi.
	- Removed utils/ivtv-detect.
	- Added utils/v4l2-ctl. Much of what was in ivtvctl is now in this
	  application (copied from v4l-dvb, www.linuxtv.org). Eventually ivtvctl
	  will disappear and all control will be done through v4l2-ctl.
	- Add getopt support to test/vbi. Add new timeout option.
	- Fix South African broadcast frequency table.

0.7.0 stable release
	- Add us-cable-irc frequency mapping. Thanks to v1h3-lj05@spamex.com.
	- Add support for the Yuan MPC622 card.
	- Add support for the Gotview PCI DVD2 Deluxe card.

0.6: see the ivtv-0.6 branch

0.5.2 release
	- removed autoload module option
	- removed tda9887 module option. If anyone needs this, then post in the
	  ivtv-devel mailinglist. There may be microtune tuners that need it, but
	  in that case the driver should be adapted to autodetect it.
	- added support for the Hauppauge A/V cable set which adds extra
	  composite and S-Video inputs.
	- the v4l2 inputs have changed. This means that you may have to
	  update your MythTV setup!
	- renamed v4l-cx2341x-init-mpeg.bin to v4l-cx2341x-init.mpg (the
	  name was too long for the 2.4 kernel firmware load, the max name
	  length in 2.4 is 20, for 2.6 it is 29).
	- fixed firmware load for amd64 systems with gcc-4.0.
	- fixed ticket #70: -window option was broken.

0.5.1 release
	- fixed memory overwrite in ivtvctl.
	- fixed memory overwrite in ivtv-detect.
	- closes #43: fixed kernel oops due to broken debug messages.
	- fixed kernel oops when loading ivtv-fb without ivtv cards being found.
	- closes #58: add workaround for the PVR150 hardware bug that affects
	  PVR150 cards with tuner models 85, 99 and 112.
	- closes #57: in v4l the number of vbi minors has been increased, which
	  allows the driver to use the '+8' scheme and to support more than
	  4 PVR350 cards.

0.5.0 release
	- removed tveeprom, tuner, v4l1-compat, msp3400 and tda9887 in favor
	  of the versions in v4l.
	- moved saa7115, saa7127, cx25840, wm8775 and cs53l32a to v4l.
	- use v4l2 API to communicate with those modules (in preparation
	  of phasing out v4l1 support).
	- renamed firmwares/init-mpeg to be more consistent:
		ivtv-fw-enc.bin    -> v4l-cx2341x-enc.fw
		ivtv-fw-dec.bin    -> v4l-cx2341x-dec.fw
		HcwMakoA.ROM       -> v4l-cx25840.fw
		ivtv_init_mpeg.bin -> v4l-cx2341x-init-mpeg.bin
	- lots of smaller ivtv cleanups.
	- added internals documentation (used to float around on several
	  internet pages, it's now part of the driver documentation).
	- setting a register of the saa7115 or saa7127 now requires root
	  permissions.
	- hotplug support is required to load the firmware. You should place
	  the firmware files in the hotplug directory.
	- add support for old-style PVR350 (with a saa7114 instead of a saa7115).
	- fix a few misdetected Hauppauge cards.
	- fix MODULE_AUTHOR lists.
	- fix VBI support in the passthrough mode.
	- cx25840ctl now uses the raw I2C API to access the cx25840.
	- updated several utilities to use getopt for better commandline handling.
	- utils/videodev2.h copy removed in favor of v4l supplied header.

0.4.0 stable release
	- specify the hardware that was found in the driver info. It is
	  shown in ivtv-detect.
	- add --log-status option to ivtvctl to produce a status report
	  in the kernel log of the board status.
	- support 2.6.14 kernel i2c and tveeprom changes.
	- fix sound on the DIAMOND PVR-550 (CX FALCON2) cards.
	- [Trev Jackson] add support for Adaptec VIDEOH! AVC-2410 and
	  Adaptec VIDEOH! AVC-2010 cards.
	- fix sound for many Philips FM/FQ type tuners (incorrect tda9887
	  default settings).
	- fix initialization sequence of the cx25840, solving problems
	  with no sound on the second PVR500 tuner.
	- add autodetect for TCL MPE05-2 tuners.
	- add special handling for SECAM to support NICAM-L audio.
	- fix ghosting when using scaled video.
	- fix occasional drop outs and corruption when using firmware versions
	  0x02040011 and earlier. The driver used byte stream based DMA for
	  these older firmwares instead of frame based. There is probably a bug
	  in the byte stream handling in the firmware, which is why the newer
	  firmware only supports frame based DMA. Many thanks go to Leonard Orb
	  for his invaluable help in tracing the cause of the drop outs.
	  Note that this only fixes part of the problem. Indications are there
	  is another bug that also triggers similar drop outs (but much more
	  rarely). The search continues...
	- recommended firmware versions are now 0x02040011 and 0x02050032.
	- 350 will try to initialise decoder so yuv playback works.
	  It loads ivtv_init_mpeg.bin from either /lib/modules or hotplug
	  firmware directory. If using hotplug file will need copying
	  there manually.
	- Add mute support for the cx25840.
	- Fix audio on external inputs for the cx25840.
	- 350 osd clears screen at startup. Can be disabled with osd_init
	  module parameter.
	- change buffering in YUV playback code to reduce CPU usage in Xv

0.3.8 release
	- switched to subversion, all old archives are imported in
	  chronological order.
	- the comment field of the version string now holds the svn revision.
	- for tagged releases a driver/ivtv-svnrelease.h header must be added
	  to the tags/X.Y.Z driver containing a fixed release string.
	- moved ChangeLog to ChangeLog.old and started a new one for the
	  subversion development.
	- upped the version to 0.3.8 to mark these changes.
	- updated the README file with information where to find the
	  subversion repository.
	- Fix radio support for Microtune 4049 FM5 tuner
	- Fix incorrect pack_stuffing_length in the embedded VBI mpeg
	  header, causing tcdecode to fail.
	- [Bryan Mayland] Added README.tda9887
	- Removed linux/stringify.h include from ivtvctl.c. Not everyone had
	  this installed.
	- IVTV_IRQ_DEC_VSYNC should only be set for cards with video output.
	- Fixed uninitialized vps variable.
	- [Boleslaw Ciesielski] Do not buffer vbi output.
	- Replace the ivtv-specific sliced VBI API with the new video4linux
	  sliced VBI API. This will break any program that uses the following
	  ioctls: IVTV_IOC_S_VBI_MODE, IVTV_IOC_G_VBI_MODE, IVTV_IOC_S_VBI_FMT,
	  IVTV_IOC_G_VBI_FMT, IVTV_IOC_TRY_VBI_FMT and IVTV_IOC_G_VBI_CAP.
	- Do not passthrough VBI data that is not in the expected line/field.
	- Autodetect the presence of a tda9887.
	- Ticket #4: poll() bug fix: check whether the given file is capturing,
	  not if *any* file is capturing. This blocked simultaneous MPEG and raw
	  VBI captures.
	- Changed the default of ivtv_dynbuf to static memory allocation.
	- Closes #5: correctly swap VBI reinsertion data when fed a non-4-byte
	  aligned mpeg file.
	- Fix VIDIOC_QUERYMENU and add VIDIOC_G_FBUF.
	- Closes #19: properly handle /dev/vbi0 and /dev/vbi4 in combination
	  with the internal VBI encoder/decoder streams.
	- YUV playback defaults to interlaced instead of auto_switching to
	  progressive for content less than 481 lines. ivtvctl has 2 new
	  options --get-yuv-mode & --set-yuv-mode that can get and set the
	  current mode. 
	- The default yuv payback mode & threshold can be set by the
	  module option ivtv_yuv_mode & ivtv_yuv_threshold
