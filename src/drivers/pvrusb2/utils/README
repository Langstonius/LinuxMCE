This directory contains utilities which aid in the use and maintenance
of the pvrusb2 driver.  Things that can be found here include:

  decode_log.cpp - This is the source for a decompiler, which is used
    to interpret the USB traffic flowing between the pvrusb2 device
    and the driver.

  decode_eeprom.cpp - This is the source for a utility that can parse
    out an FX2 load image from an eeprom image.  The FX2 loads code
    from a resident eeprom using packets in the eeprom.  This program
    can parse each packet and emit a set of s-records of the contained
    data (which can then be fed to a disassembler).

  fwextract.pl - This is a Perl program which can extract firmware
    data out of Hauppauge's Windows driver files.

  fwfind.sh - This is a shell script which is a wrapper around
    fwextract.pl.  It attempts to download an appropriate driver
    package, expand it, and then feed it to fwextract.pl for further
    processing.

  old-extract-firmware.pl - This is the old firmware extractor created
    by Björn Danielsson <pvrusb2@dax.nu>.  Use the newer fwextract.pl
    program instead; this is included here for historical reasons and
    also as a fallback in case problems are encountered with the new
    extractor.

  pvrui.sh - Shell script that uses the dialog utility to implement an
    interactive front end to the sysfs interface of the driver.  NOTE:
    This script is fairly broken at the moment.  New types have since
    been introduced into the sysfs interface and the script doesn't
    handle enum values with embedded spaces very well.  This needs to
    be fixed.

  usbreplayprep.pl - This is a Perl script which can postprocess USB
    sniffer output into a compact form that the decompiler can parse.
    This also originally came from Björn however it has been modified
    to also preserve data coming from the device (older version only
    preserved data going *to* the device).

  (The following are hacks I threw together to help with maintaining
  the source code.)

  release_snapshot.pl - This is a Perl script I use for releasing
    snapshots and creating the generated HTML pages.

  svn_helper.pl - This is a utility I wrote for massaging a snapshot
    of the driver sources into something appropriate for the V4L
    source tree.  This uses Subversion to set up a proposed tag
    sandbox with all the sources appropriately places, all Id keywords
    stripped down (to make diffs easier) and all conditionally
    compiled code which is false for V4L to be removed.

Run "make" in this directory and decode_log & decode_eeprom will be
compiled.  These programs have no external dependencies; you only need
a C++ compiler to build them.

To use this decompiler (decode_log), feed the output of
usbreplayprep.pl into its stdin.  The results will be sent to stdout.
Examine the contents at the top of decode_log.cpp for more
information.

To use decode_eeprom, specify the name of the raw eeprom image file as
the first argument, and if you wish to emit the s-record result then
also specify the name of the s-record output file as the second
argument.

The usbreplayprep.pl script expects USB sniffer data in its stdin,
while its results will go to stdout.  The USB sniffer can be found
here:  http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/

See pvrusb2-utils.html in the doc sibling directory for information on
what you can do with these utilities.
