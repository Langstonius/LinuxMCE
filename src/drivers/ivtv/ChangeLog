IVTV changes:

0.4.2 stable release
	- ticket #29: apply i2c patch to address PVR-150 IR chip issues. Also
	  seems to fix i2c detection problems that occur in rare cases.
	  This patch makes the ivtv i2c implementation work the same as the
	  windows driver.
	- renamed v4l-cx2341x-init-mpeg.bin to v4l-cx2341x-init.mpg (the
	  name was too long for the 2.4 kernel firmware load, the max name
	  length in 2.4 is 20, for 2.6 it is 29).
	- fixed firmware load for amd64 systems with gcc-4.0.
	- fixed ticket #70: -window option was broken.
	- fixed ticket #71: bug in handling the hue control and in the
	  brightness control (wrong value was returned).
	- backported 0.5 change: OVERFLOW warnings are now shown only once.
	- ticket #63: add support for Samsung TCPN 2121P30A tuner.
	- cx25840ctl uses the i2c bus to communicate with the cx25840.
	- fix ivtv build for 2.6.15 kernel.
	- ivtvctl --log-status now outputs the log directly (no need to
	  look in the kernel log).

0.4.1 stable release
	Big synchronization with the 0.5.x series to keep the changes to a
	minimum:
	- support 2.6.15 kernel changes.
	- use v4l2 API to communicate with those modules (in preparation
	  of phasing out v4l1 support).
	- renamed firmwares/init-mpeg to be more consistent:
		ivtv-fw-enc.bin    -> v4l-cx2341x-enc.fw
		ivtv-fw-dec.bin    -> v4l-cx2341x-dec.fw
		HcwMakoA.ROM       -> v4l-cx25840.fw
		ivtv_init_mpeg.bin -> v4l-cx2341x-init-mpeg.bin
	- lots of smaller ivtv cleanups.
	- added internals documentation (used to float around on several
	  internet pages, it's now part of the driver documentation).
	- setting a register of the saa7115 or saa7127 now requires root
	  permissions.
	- add support for old-style PVR350 (with a saa7114 instead of a saa7115).
	- fix a few misdetected Hauppauge cards.
	- fix MODULE_AUTHOR lists.
	- fix VBI support in the passthrough mode.
	- cx25840ctl now uses the raw I2C API to access the cx25840.
	- updated several utilities to use getopt for better commandline handling.
	- fixed memory overwrite in ivtvctl.
	- fixed memory overwrite in ivtv-detect.
	- closes #43: fixed kernel oops due to broken debug messages.
	- fixed kernel oops when loading ivtv-fb without ivtv cards being found.
	- closes #58: add workaround for the PVR150 hardware bug that affects
	  PVR150 cards with tuner models 85, 99 and 112.
	- Input numbering for PVR150/500 cards have changed, this will
	  require users to reconfigure apps that use these cards.
	  0="Tuner" 1="Composite 0" 2="Composite 1" 3="S-Video 0" 4="S-Video 1"

0.4.0 stable release
	- specify the hardware that was found in the driver info. It is
	  shown in ivtv-detect.
	- add --log-status option to ivtvctl to produce a status report
	  in the kernel log of the board status.
	- support 2.6.14 kernel i2c and tveeprom changes.
	- fix sound on the DIAMOND PVR-550 (CX FALCON2) cards.
	- [Trev Jackson] add support for Adaptec VIDEOH! AVC-2410 and
	  Adaptec VIDEOH! AVC-2010 cards.
	- fix sound for many Philips FM/FQ type tuners (incorrect tda9887
	  default settings).
	- fix initialization sequence of the cx25840, solving problems
	  with no sound on the second PVR500 tuner.
	- add autodetect for TCL MPE05-2 tuners.
	- add special handling for SECAM to support NICAM-L audio.
	- fix ghosting when using scaled video.
	- fix occasional drop outs and corruption when using firmware versions
	  0x02040011 and earlier. The driver used byte stream based DMA for
	  these older firmwares instead of frame based. There is probably a bug
	  in the byte stream handling in the firmware, which is why the newer
	  firmware only supports frame based DMA. Many thanks go to Leonard Orb
	  for his invaluable help in tracing the cause of the drop outs.
	  Note that this only fixes part of the problem. Indications are there
	  is another bug that also triggers similar drop outs (but much more
	  rarely). The search continues...
	- recommended firmware versions are now 0x02040011 and 0x02050032.
	- 350 will try to initialise decoder so yuv playback works.
	  It loads ivtv_init_mpeg.bin from either /lib/modules or hotplug
	  firmware directory. If using hotplug file will need copying
	  there manually.
	- Add mute support for the cx25840.
	- Fix audio on external inputs for the cx25840.
	- 350 osd clears screen at startup. Can be disabled with osd_init
	  module parameter.
	- change buffering in YUV playback code to reduce CPU usage in Xv

0.3.8 release
	- switched to subversion, all old archives are imported in
	  chronological order.
	- the comment field of the version string now holds the svn revision.
	- for tagged releases a driver/ivtv-svnrelease.h header must be added
	  to the tags/X.Y.Z driver containing a fixed release string.
	- moved ChangeLog to ChangeLog.old and started a new one for the
	  subversion development.
	- upped the version to 0.3.8 to mark these changes.
	- updated the README file with information where to find the
	  subversion repository.
	- Fix radio support for Microtune 4049 FM5 tuner
	- Fix incorrect pack_stuffing_length in the embedded VBI mpeg
	  header, causing tcdecode to fail.
	- [Bryan Mayland] Added README.tda9887
	- Removed linux/stringify.h include from ivtvctl.c. Not everyone had
	  this installed.
	- IVTV_IRQ_DEC_VSYNC should only be set for cards with video output.
	- Fixed uninitialized vps variable.
	- [Boleslaw Ciesielski] Do not buffer vbi output.
	- Replace the ivtv-specific sliced VBI API with the new video4linux
	  sliced VBI API. This will break any program that uses the following
	  ioctls: IVTV_IOC_S_VBI_MODE, IVTV_IOC_G_VBI_MODE, IVTV_IOC_S_VBI_FMT,
	  IVTV_IOC_G_VBI_FMT, IVTV_IOC_TRY_VBI_FMT and IVTV_IOC_G_VBI_CAP.
	- Do not passthrough VBI data that is not in the expected line/field.
	- Autodetect the presence of a tda9887.
	- Ticket #4: poll() bug fix: check whether the given file is capturing,
	  not if *any* file is capturing. This blocked simultaneous MPEG and raw
	  VBI captures.
	- Changed the default of ivtv_dynbuf to static memory allocation.
	- Closes #5: correctly swap VBI reinsertion data when fed a non-4-byte
	  aligned mpeg file.
	- Fix VIDIOC_QUERYMENU and add VIDIOC_G_FBUF.
	- Closes #19: properly handle /dev/vbi0 and /dev/vbi4 in combination
	  with the internal VBI encoder/decoder streams.
	- YUV playback defaults to interlaced instead of auto_switching to
	  progressive for content less than 481 lines. ivtvctl has 2 new
	  options --get-yuv-mode & --set-yuv-mode that can get and set the
	  current mode. 
	- The default yuv payback mode & threshold can be set by the
	  module option ivtv_yuv_mode & ivtv_yuv_threshold
