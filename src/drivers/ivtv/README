This is the README for the ivtv module suite.

The primary goal of the IVTV project is to provide a "clean room" Linux 
Open Source driver implementation for video capture cards based on the 
iCompression iTVC15 or Conexant CX23415/CX23416 MPEG Codec. Examples of 
such cards are the Hauppauge PVR 150/250/350/500 series of MPEG video 
capture cards, the Hauppauge "freestyle" and the AVerMedia M179 AVerTV. 

A special note regarding the PVR-500: this card basically consists of two
PVR-150 cards on one board but with the following difference: Radio,
Composite video and S-video are only hooked up to the first PVR-150 instance.

Features:
 * Hardware mpeg2 capture of broadcast video (and sound) via the tuner or
   s-video/audio line-in
 * Hardware mpeg2 capture of FM radio where hardware support exists
 * Supports NTSC, PAL, SECAM with stereo sound
 * Provides hardware mpeg2 playback
 * Provides comprehensive OSD (On Screen Display: ie. graphics overlaying the
   video signal)
 * Provides a framebuffer (allowing X applications to appear on the video
   device)

NOTE 1: Starting with ivtv-0.4.1 kernel hotplug support is used to load the
firmware if the kernel supports this. Firmware hotplug support appeared in
kernel 2.4.23. The names for the firmware files also changed in the 0.4.1 release
to keep them compatible with the 0.5.x series which is preparing the driver for
inclusion in the linux kernel.

NOTE 2: The PVR150/500 inputs (e.g. tuner, composite 0/1 or S-Video 0/1 input)
were reordered in 0.4.1. You will have to correct the input setting of
applications such as MythTV that make use of this.

NOTE 3: If you have kernel 2.6.15 then only the ivtv modules are built if you
have enabled the supporting audio/video modules in the kernel (config options
CONFIG_VIDEO_AUDIO_DECODER and CONFIG_VIDEO_DECODER).
The supporting audio/video modules are now part of that kernel and so the
kernel modules can be used instead of the ivtv-supplied ones.

If you use the kernel modules, then make sure you have removed any old
ivtv-based msp3400, saa7115, saa7127, cx25840, cs53l32a, wm8775, tuner,
tveeprom and tda9887 modules.

If you need the new Samsung TCPN 2121P30A tuner support and you are using
the 2.6.15 support audio/video modules, then you must edit drivers/Kbuild:
replace this:

	ifndef NO_IVTV_TUNER
	obj-m += tuner.o tveeprom.o tda9887.o
	endif
	endif

by:

	endif
	ifndef NO_IVTV_TUNER
	obj-m += tuner.o tveeprom.o tda9887.o
	endif

The support for this is not in the 2.6.15 kernel so you need to use the ivtv
supplied tuner and tveeprom modules.

This 0.4 series will not support kernels higher than 2.6.15. Until ivtv ends
up in the kernel there will be kernel-specific ivtv releases. ivtv-0.X will
match kernel 2.6.1X.

Note: the old sourceforge ivtv project is no longer active and will
redirect to ivtvdriver.org. All development now takes place in the
subversion repository on ivtvdriver.org.
