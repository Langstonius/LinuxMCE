This is the README for the ivtv module suite.

The primary goal of the IVTV project is to provide a "clean room" Linux 
Open Source driver implementation for video capture cards based on the 
iCompression iTVC15 or Conexant CX23415/CX23416 MPEG Codec. Examples of 
such cards are the Hauppauge PVR 150/250/350/500 series of MPEG video 
capture cards, the Hauppauge "freestyle" and the AVerMedia M179 AVerTV. 

A special note regarding the PVR-500: this card basically consists of two
PVR-150 cards on one board but with the following difference: Radio,
Composite video and S-video are only hooked up to the first PVR-150 instance.

Features:
 * Hardware mpeg2 capture of broadcast video (and sound) via the tuner or
   s-video/audio line-in
 * Hardware mpeg2 capture of FM radio where hardware support exists
 * Supports NTSC, PAL, SECAM with stereo sound
 * Provides hardware mpeg2 playback
 * Provides comprehensive OSD (On Screen Display: ie. graphics overlaying the
   video signal)
 * Provides a framebuffer (allowing X applications to appear on the video
   device)
