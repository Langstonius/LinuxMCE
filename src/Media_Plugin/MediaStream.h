    /** @brief
     * An instance of media, such as a DVD or a CD.  If 2 people start watching the same DVD individually, that will be 2 media streams,
     * because they are independent.
     * However, if 1 person starts watching and another joins in, or the media is broadcast, it becomes a single stream with multiple destinations.  In this case, all
     * the destinations are seeing the same thing, and the appropriate plug-in must concern itself with proper audio/video sync,
     * and ensure that if 1 person changes the stream, they all stay in sync.
     * It is possible to do this even with non-stored media, like Broadcast TV.
     * Whatever media plugin first created the media is considered the 'responsible' plug-in.  A MediaStream can contain a 'playlist' or group
     * of files or media clips.  However, all must be of the same type since there is only 1 MediaHandlerInfo for a stream.  You cannot, therefore, mix
     * audio and video clips in a playlist, or some stored audio (WAV, MP3, etc) with CD's or DVD's.
