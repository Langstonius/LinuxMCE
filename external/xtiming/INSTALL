xtiming requires that you have the ability to execute Perl5 CGI scripts.  
To install, simply untar the distribution in your HTML tree somewhere, 
then try it out.

Example: Installing xtiming as a user, with the typical public_html 
         user HTML directory.
cd ~/public_html
gzip -dc xtiming-3.2.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
lynx http://localhost/~$USER/xtiming-3.2.0/cgi-bin/xtiming.pl

Example: Installing xtiming as a system administrator, into the typical 
         Apache CGI directory.
cd /usr/local/apache
gzip -dc xtiming-3.2.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
cp -R xtiming-3.2.0/cgi-bin/* cgi-bin
cp -R xtiming-3.2.0/images htdocs
lynx http://localhost/cgi-bin/xtiming.pl
