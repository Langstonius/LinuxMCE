Q. I'm installing as a user, and CGI execution is unavailable.
A. Convince your system administrator to give you CGI execution 
   priveleges.  xtiming is a CGI script.

Q. Only CGIs with a ".cgi" extension get executed.
A. Rename xtiming.pl to xtiming.cgi.

Q. Only CGIs in the top cgi-bin directory (eg, $HOME/public_html/cgi-bin) 
   get executed.
A. Move the contents of the xtiming cgi-bin directory into the top cgi-bin 
   directory, and move the images directory to match.  For example:
   cd $HOME/public_html
   mv xtiming-3.2.0/cgi-bin/* cgi-bin
   mv xtiming-3.2.0/images .

Q. My Perl5 is not in /usr/local/bin.
A. Change the first line of xtiming.pl to point to your Perl5 executable.

Q. Is xtiming somewhere online, so I don't have to install it?
A. Yes, at http://xtiming.sourceforge.net/.
