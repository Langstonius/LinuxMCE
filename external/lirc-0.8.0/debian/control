Package: lirc
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Pre-Depends: dialog
Suggests: lirc-modules-source, lirc-x, lirc-svga
Description: Linux Infra-red Remote Control support
 This package provides the daemons and some utilities to support infra-red
 remote controls under Linux.

Package: lirc-x
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, lirc (= ${Source-Version})
Replaces: lirc (<< 0.6.4-8)
Recommends: xfonts-75dpi
Description: Linux Infra-red Remote Control support (X dependent parts)
 This package provides those parts of lirc which depend on the XWindow system.
 .
 Currently:
 .
 irxevent: Allows you to control your X applications with your remote control.
 .
 xmode2: shows the IR waveform of the remote controller without an expensive
 oscilloscope (through an X window). This is not needed for TV cards or the
 Irman.
 .
 You ***MUST*** <--- (really!) have the xfonts-75dpi package available on the
 X server, whether via files or via a font server like xfs. The lirc-x package
 only Recommends: these packages because it's possible to have them served
 remotely, but you really should install them. :)

Package: lirc-svga
Architecture: amd64 i386
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, lirc (= ${Source-Version})
Replaces: lirc (<< 0.6.4-8)
Description: Linux Infra-red Remote Control support (svgalib dependent parts)
 This package provides those parts of lirc which depend on svgalib .
 .
 Currently:
 .
 smode2: shows the IR waveform of the remote controller without an expensive
 oscilloscope (through svgalib). This is not needed for TV cards or the Irman.

Conflicts: lirc (<<0.6.3-1)
Description: Linux Infra-red Remote Control support (kernel modules)
 This package provides the source for the kernel modules to support
 infra-red remote controls under Linux.
 .
 Please note that the kernel sources must be installed to compile these
 modules.

Package: liblircclient-dev
Architecture: any
Section: libdevel
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, liblircclient0 (= ${Source-Version}), libc6-dev

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: lirc
Description: LIRC client library
 This library provides functions so that other programs (eg xawtv)
 can support remote controls via LIRC.
