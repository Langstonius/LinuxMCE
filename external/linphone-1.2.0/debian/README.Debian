Converting the address book entries between versions 0.12.2 and 1.0.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------
You seem to have lost your address book while updating linphone?

Linphone has changed the format in which address book entries are stored between
versions 0.12.2 and 1.0.0.

To see your old entries back with a new version of linphone you can use the perl
script cv_addr_book.pl provided in /usr/share/doc/linphone/. You only have to
run it once under your current user (don't forget to chmod +x the script before
running it).

If you don't want to know the details, don't read the following paragraph. The
address book is stored in the file ~/.gnome2/linphone. The old entries were in
this format:

[address_book]
entry_count=4
entry0=Name0 <sip:user0@host0>
entry1=Name1 <sip:user1@host1>
...

whereas new entries are in this format:

[friend_0]
url=Name0 <sip:user0@host0>
pol=wait
subscribe=1
proxy=-1

etc.

Sorry for the inconveniences caused by this change.
