<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The main purpose of these programs is to check operation of your
home-brew LIRC receiver hardware and to see the IR waveform of the
remote controller without an expensive oscilloscope. Very useful for
debugging. Of course this program won't work with hardware that decodes
the signals itself like e.g. TV cards or the Irman.

smode2 uses the svgalib to show the IR waveform in a graphical
representation. The time division is variable from 1 ms/unit to
extremely high values (integer type) but there is no point increasing
this value above 20 ms/unit, because one pulse is about 1 ms. This kind
of presentation is much more exciting than the simple pulse&amp;space output
showed by mode2.
