    The -experimental package will depend on "icewm" and provide compatibility
    symlinks for a while.

      is provided by debhelper.
    - debian/icons/icewm*.xpm: added icewm icons.
    - debian/icewm*.postinst: remove menu method for previous versions since

    Several menu-methods building the same file (/etc/X11/icewm/programs) make
    no sense (only the last do something useful).
