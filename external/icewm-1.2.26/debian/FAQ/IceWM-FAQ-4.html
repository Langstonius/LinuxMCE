<H2><A NAME="s4">4.</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc4">Configuration</A></H2>

<P>Congratulations! Now you have IceWM up and running. You don't like
the default look? Don't worry: This section is on customizing IceWM.</P>
<P>As it is the case with most Linux and Unix programs IceWM can be
configured using plain text config files. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc4.1">You mean I have to edit these files?</A>
</H2>

<P>There is a lot of utilities nowadays. See utilities section -
<A HREF="IceWM-FAQ-11.html#tools4icewm">Tools for IceWM</A>.</P>
<P>The config files need to be changed if you want to change IceWM's
behavior.  This does not necessarily mean that you have to use an
editor for this - graphical configuration tools for IceWM are
available, although IceWM doesn't feature in-built configuration. More
about these tools in the Utilities section. 
Still hand editing of these files is most effective and you can find even more
than you are looking for.
To notify IceWM about the
changes you've made just send it a SIGHUP or restart it from the Logout
menu.</P>

<H2><A NAME="conffiles"></A> <A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc4.2">Where are the configuration files?</A>
</H2>

<P>You could not find the config files? Maybe you were looking in wrong
places - the location depends upon the method you used to install
IceWM.</P>
<P>In a plain vanilla source install, the global version of the files
will be located in <CODE>/usr/local/lib/Xll/icewm/</CODE>. If
you installed the standard RPM, they will be in
<CODE>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm/</CODE> or <CODE>/usr/local/share/icewm</CODE>. The system wide
configuration files for the Debian package seem to be in
<CODE>/etc/X11/icewm/</CODE>.</P>
<P>However, if you wish to make a configuration of your own you should
not edit these global config files but create a subdirectory of your
home directory called <CODE>~/.icewm/</CODE>. Copy the system
wide files to your local <CODE>.icewm</CODE> directory and
edit these copies.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> You may have to alter the permissions of the copies in
order to read and write to them.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc4.3">The configuration files</A>
</H2>

<P>You can customize IceWM by editing the following configuration files:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>&quot;menu&quot;</CODE></B><DD><P>Controls the contents of the <CODE>start</CODE> menu</P>
<DT><B><CODE>&quot;preferences&quot;</CODE></B><DD><P>Controls the general behavior of IceWM</P>
<DT><B><CODE>&quot;keys&quot;</CODE></B><DD><P>Controls which additional key combos are available to users</P>
<DT><B><CODE>&quot;toolbar&quot;</CODE></B><DD><P>Controls the row of launcher icons on the taskbar and has the
same syntax as the menu file</P>
<DT><B><CODE>&quot;winoptions&quot;</CODE></B><DD><P>Controls the behavior of individual applications (as identified
by the names of their respective windows)</P>
<DT><B><CODE>&quot;startup&quot;</CODE></B><DD><P>Applications that should be started at IceWM startup.</P>
<DT><B><CODE>&quot;theme&quot;</CODE></B><DD><P>IceWM theme path/name. </P>
<DT><B><CODE>&quot;prefoverride&quot;</CODE></B><DD><P>To override theme preferences.</P>
</DL>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="menu"></A> menu</H3>

<P>The <CODE>menu</CODE> file controls the contents in your menu (You knew that,
right?). It has the following syntax:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    prog Program Icon app -with -options
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
prog
</PRE>
 is a keyword, telling IceWM that it's a program entry. Other keywords
are 
<PRE>
separator
</PRE>
 to draw a separator and 
<PRE>
menu Xyz folder_icon {
  prog ...
}
</PRE>
 to open a new sub menu called Xyz. 
<PRE>
Program
</PRE>
 is
the name which will be shown in the menu. Enclose it in apostrophes if you
need more than one word here. 
<PRE>
Icon
</PRE>
 will be used as the menu
entry's icon, if a corresponding image is found in IceWM's IconSearchPath.
And finally 
<PRE>
app -with -options
</PRE>
 is what's going to be started if
a user chooses this entry.</P>

<P>Note that the menu only shows entries which are found in your PATH, IceWM is
clever enough to omit non-usable entries.</P>

<H3>preferences</H3>

<P>The <CODE>preferences</CODE> file is the main configuration file. The default
file is pretty much self documenting, so go and have a look. In case you
ever wondered about themes: they can define all the options you can use in
this file - and their definitions <B>override</B> all your personal customization!</P>

<H3>keys</H3>

<P>In the <CODE>keys</CODE> file one can define shortcuts for starting programs.
The existing entries make clear what one has to define.</P>

<H3>toolbar</H3>

<P>The <CODE>toolbar</CODE> file defines some buttons which can be clicked next to
the menu in the toolbar. It uses the same format as the menu file. 
You can also have folders in the toolbar. The easiest way to do that 
is simply by copying a menu from the /menu file over to the /toolbar file. </P>

<H3>winoptions</H3>

<P>The <CODE>winoptions</CODE> file can be used to define the appearance of X
applications like on which desktop they should appear, if should have a
border, menu, titlebar, etc.</P>

<H3><A NAME="startup"></A> startup</H3>

<P>The <CODE>startup</CODE> file can list apps you want to start at IceWM startup.
It can look like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
idesk&amp; 
(sleep 2; psi&amp;)&amp;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Do not forget to make this file executable
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
chmod +x startup
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Note: Do not put shell specification (like #!/bin/bash) on the beginning of the file.
Also make sure all applications are starting at background (&amp;).</P>

<H3><A NAME="theme"></A> theme</H3>

<P>The <CODE>theme</CODE> file is new from IceWM 1.2.10. It specifies which 
theme should be used
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Theme=myfavorittheme/default.theme
#Theme=myfavorittheme/default.theme
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P># contains theme history. </P>

<P>The <CODE>theme</CODE> file is changed every time you 
switch theme in menu and selected theme is therefore used after IceWM restart.</P>

<H3>prefoverride</H3>

<P>The <CODE>prefoverride</CODE> file is new from IceWM 1.2.12. In this file you can
specify any preference which will override any preference specified by theme or 
anything else. This is introduced to solve troubles with order of preferences 
interpretation and give a usr possibility to customize global things he wants to
have allways same.</P>
