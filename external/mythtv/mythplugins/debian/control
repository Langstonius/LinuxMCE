Description: create and burn DVD's from MythTV - binary file
 MythArchive is a plugin for MythTV that lets you create DVDs from your
 recorded shows, MythVideo files and any video files available on your
 system. It can also archive recordings in a proprietary format that
 archives not only the file but also all the associated metadata like title,
 description and cut list information which will mean you can create backups
 of myth recordings which can later be restored or it will also allow you to
 move recordings between myth systems without losing any of the metadata. It
 is a complete rewrite of the old MythBurn bash scripts, now using python,
 and the mythfrontend UI plugin.
