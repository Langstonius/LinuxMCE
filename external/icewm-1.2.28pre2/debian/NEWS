icewm (1.2.13+CVS20031225-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Noteworthy changes / new features:

  many users are confused with feature improvements and feature
  reordering in the recent versions of IceWM, so here is a short summary
  that may interest you if you run IceWM as stand-alone session program:

  - Most important change: IceWM is no longer monolitic! The
    functionality has been splited out into different helper programs:
    icewm (core window manager), icewmbg (background setter), icewmtray
    (manages the Tray area), icewm-menu-gnome-* (Gnome menu parsers),
    icewm-session (runs them all as needed and controls icewm's execution)
    You need to run icewm-session (or -lite/-experimental flavors) instead of
    icewm in order to get all the functions known from previous versions at
    once
  - IceWM got Docklet support known from KDE. Applications like PSI
    and Gaim may put an active Docklet icon into the Tray area
  - IceWM got FreeType spport which results in nicely rendered fonts and
    throughout UTF-8 support. Unfortunately, it also became touchy to
    incorrect locale settings
  - More image formats are supported by icewmbg now
  - Lots of minor improvements like Xinerama support and nested theme menu
