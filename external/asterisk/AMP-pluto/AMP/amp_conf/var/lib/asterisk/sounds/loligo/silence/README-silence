These files consist of silence.  I have found in certain circumstances when
prompting the user for keystrokes that the Wait() application does not
actually listen for DTMF, so often if you have a loop with a Wait() that
pauses between two Background() audio files, you will lose keystrokes from
the user.  To combat that, I have created a bunch of sound files that should
get used instead of Wait(), and these can be played back with Background()
