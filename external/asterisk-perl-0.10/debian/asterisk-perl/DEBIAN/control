Description: perl modules for interfacing with the Asterisk PBX.
 asterisk-perl is a collection of perl modules to be used with the Asterisk PBX, an open source pbx system developed by Mark Spencer.
 Currently the most used module is Asterisk::AGI which makes writing agi scripts simple. There are a number of example AGI scripts included in asterisk-perl, there is a listing of available examples in the README file.
 If you want to write complex AGI scripts in perl, then Asterisk::AGI is for you.
