Description: ALSA library additional plugins
 This package contains plugins for the ALSA library that are
 not included in the main libasound2 package.
 .
 The ALSA library plugin "jack" allows the ALSA library to
 play or capture via JACK. (This should not be confused with
 the jackd output driver "alsa", included in the jackd
 package, which allows the JACK daemon to play back via the
 ALSA library.)
 .
 ALSA is the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.
 JACK is the Jack Audio Connection Kit.
