.SH NAME
hald \- daemon for Hardware Abstraction Layer

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hald 
[\-\-daemon=yes|no] [\-\-verbose=yes|no] [\-\-retain\-privileges] [\-\-help]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The HAL daemon detects devices present in the system and provides the
org.freedesktop.Hal service through D\-BUS.
 
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.

.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`\-').
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
.BR \-\-daemon=yes|no
By default, \fBhald\fP detaches from the current tty and
starts running in the background, thus becoming a daemon.
You can suppress this behaviour by using \fBno\fP here.
.TP
.BR \-\-retain\-privileges
Run as root instead of normal user (calling of external scripts to modify 
fstab etc. will not work when not running as root)
.TP
.BR \-\-verbose=yes|no
\fBhald\fP prints out debug information when this is set to yes.
