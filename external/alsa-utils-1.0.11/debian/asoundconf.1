.SH DESCRIPTION
.B asoundconf
configures the ALSA library for the user.
It does this by reading the values of parameters from
and writing the values of parameters
to the special file .asoundrc.asoundconf
in the user's home directory.
The .asoundrc.asoundconf file should not be edited by hand!
.PP
The .asoundrc.asoundconf file only has an effect
on the ALSA library
if it is included by the user's .asoundrc file,
also located in the user's home directory.
When
.B asoundconf
is run and it finds either
that the ~/.asoundrc file does not exist
or that the file exists and contains the markers
of the obsolete
.B set\-default\-soundcard
program then
.B asoundconf
adds the required inclusion statement to ~/.asoundrc;
otherwise
.B asoundconf
does not change ~/.asoundrc.
Hence, if you want to disable control
of ALSA library configuration parameters by
.B asoundconf
then simply comment out this inclusion statement
but do not delete the ~/.asoundrc file.
(It is OK for ~/.asoundrc to be an empty file.)
.SH WARNING
This program is under development.
Its features will change without notice
and without preservation of backward compatibility,
except insofar as they are put to use
by other components of
the Debian and/or Ubuntu operating systems.
(As of this writing the Ubuntu developers have plans to use
.B asoundconf
for setting the value of defaults.pcm.card from the
system sound preferences menu.)
