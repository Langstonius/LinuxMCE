This Wrapper is a convenience lib intended for packagers and XvMC
player developers. It dlopens an XvMC lib at runtime, and therefore
allows an XvMC-enabled player to link with the wrapper and the user to
choose which library to load. 

The library loaded is determined as follows.
1. The wrapper queries the X server. If the X server does not give an answer, 
2. It looks in the file /etc/X11/XvMCConfig. The path of this file is
possible  to specify during the configure phase. See ./configure --help.

The package is distributed with a sample XvMCConfig file. 

The library and include file are installed in the standard X
locations. There's really no way to change that. The only thing you
can change is the path of the configure file.
