It is a boot speed performance oriented implementation of hotplug
written in Perl. It requires a 2.6 kernel with hotplug and Perl 5.8. It
was developed with Debian Sarge as the target, but should work
elsewhere. The web page includes bootcharts demonstrating the
performance improvement over the bash implementation of hotplug.
