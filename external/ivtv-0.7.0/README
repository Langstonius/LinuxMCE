This is the README for the ivtv module suite.

---------------- NOTES -----------------
NOTE 1: The ivtv-0.7.x release is for the 2.6.17 kernel. It does NOT compile with
older kernels. If you want to use ivtv on older kernels, then you should use
ivtv-0.4.X or ivtv-0.6.X instead. The ivtv-0.4 series provides support for kernels
up to 2.6.15 only. The 0.6 release is for kernel 2.6.16. The 0.7 release is
guaranteed NOT to work with kernels >= 2.6.18, look at www.ivtvdriver.org
for more information by the time such kernels appear.
---------------- NOTES -----------------

The primary goal of the IVTV project is to provide a "clean room" Linux 
Open Source driver implementation for video capture cards based on the 
iCompression iTVC15 or Conexant CX23415/CX23416 MPEG Codec.

The following cards are supported:

Hauppauge WinTV PVR 250
Hauppauge WinTV PVR 350
Hauppauge WinTV PVR-150
Hauppauge WinTV PVR-500
AVerMedia M179
Yuan MPG600/Kuroutoshikou iTVC16-STVLP
Yuan MPG160/Kuroutoshikou iTVC15-STVLP
Yuan PG600/DiamondMM PVR-550 (CX Falcon 2)
Adaptec AVC-2410
Adaptec AVC-2010
Nagase Transgear 5000TV
AOpen VA2000MAX-STN6
Yuan MPG600GR/Kuroutoshikou CX23416GYC-STVLP
I/O Data GV-MVP/RX
I/O Data GV-MVP/RX2E
Gotview PCI DVD (preliminary support only)
Gotview PCI DVD2 Deluxe
Yuan MPC622
DIGITAL COWBOY DCT-MTVP1

A special note regarding the PVR-500: this card basically consists of two
PVR-150 cards on one board but with the following difference: Radio,
Composite video and S-video are only hooked up to the first PVR-150 instance.

The Hauppauge cable set that you can buy for their cards to add an additional
Composite/S-Video input is also supported.

Features:
 * Hardware mpeg2 capture of broadcast video (and sound) via the tuner or
   S-Video/Composite and audio line-in.
 * Hardware mpeg2 capture of FM radio where hardware support exists
 * Supports NTSC, PAL, SECAM with stereo sound
 * Supports SAP and bilingual transmissions.
 * Supports raw VBI (closed captions and teletext).
 * Supports raw YUV and PCM input.

Additional features for the PVR-350 (CX23415 based):
 * Provides hardware mpeg2 playback
 * Provides comprehensive OSD (On Screen Display: ie. graphics overlaying the
   video signal)
 * Provides a framebuffer (allowing X applications to appear on the video
   device)
 * Supports raw YUV output.
