ivtv (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Remove postinst.modules.in since dh_installmodules already adds
    the required depmod calls and there is nothing else left.
    (Closes: #381752)
  * Patch 50_non-i386-portability has been merged upstream.
  * Update debian/watch for 0.7.

ivtv (0.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Replaced 50_non-i386-portability.dpatch with an improved version which has
    been submitted upstream. This also removes the need to set $(X86) in
    debian/rules.
  * 75_svn-r3315-initialize-struct-v4l2_frequency.type.dpatch was included
    upstream.

  [ Ian Campbell ]
  * Convert build system to use dpatch.
  * Nothing uses $DEBIAN_MAKE_KPKG anymore so drop it.
  * Backport r3315 from svn which ensures that the tuner is set to TV and not
    radio mode when initializing the driver.
  * Depend on debhelper >= 5.0.37 so as to get a dh_installmodules which
    calls depmod correctly for us. Add call to dh_installmodules when
    building module packages.

  * Only compile ivtvplay, ivtv-mpegindex and ivtv-encoder on i386 and amd64
    since they use non-portable assembly code.

ivtv (0.6.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Ian Campbell ]
  * Change package to Priority: extra rather than Priority: optional due to
    dependency on packages which are Priority: extra, as per policy section
    2.5.
  * Fix spelling error in ivtv-utils description. (Closes: #363981)
  * Do not attempt to clean the drivers subdirectory during a normal
    build. The files in this directory are only built by kdist_modules and
    so should only be cleaned by kdist_clean. The necessary kernel files
    may not be present when running the regular clean target leading to
    FTBFS problems.

ivtv (0.6.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

    from non-Debian packaging.
  * Move to contrib as the driver requires non-free firmware.

ivtv (0.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix Makefile2.4. Kbuild needs to be included for both branches of the
    ifneq.
  * Changes to ivtv-make-fwpkg suggested by Marc Haber:
    - The environment variable containing the maintainer e-mail address
      is DEBEMAIL, not DEBMAIL.
    - The build script should abort after "Failed to determine firmware
      version."
    - The build script should abort with a clear error message if no
      firmware file is given on the command line.
  * Remove a skeletal ivtvctl.1 manpage from the diff, it's worse than
    useless.
  * Clean in driver directory.
  * IVTV_WARN is no longer used.

    over. Also include videodev.h in the module source package.

    - ivtv-fw-enc.bin    -> v4l-cx2341x-enc.fw
    - ivtv-fw-dec.bin    -> v4l-cx2341x-dec.fw
    - HcwMakoA.ROM       -> v4l-cx25840.fw
    - ivtv_init_mpeg.bin -> v4l-cx2341x-init-mpeg.bin
  * Remove depmod call from driver/Makefile, postinst will do it instead.

    debian/rules accordingly.
  * utils/ now installs to $(PREFIX) not $(INSTALLDIR)
  * Include ivtv_init_mpeg.bin in utils package. I'm unsure how this will
    work with a 2.4 kernel -- a symbolic link from /lib/modules might also
    be required.
  * Added IVTV_WARN in driver/ivtv-driver.h
