Firmware
--------

The IVTV drivers requires firmware which must be downloaded and
installed separately. The available versions of the firmware are
listed at http://ivtv.writeme.ch/tiki-index.php?page=FirmwareVersions.

If your kernel has firmware loader support (CONFIG_FW_LOADER) you can
use the ivtv-make-fwpkg tool to create a binary package containing the
firmware. If your kernel does not include firmware loader support then
you will need to the firmware manually using the ivtvfwextract tool
and copy it into /lib/modules.

ivtv-make-fwpkg
---------------

Before running the ivtv-make-fwpkg tool you should set DEBFULLNAME and
DEBEMAIL in your environment so that the package maintainer field can
be filled in correctly:

  $ export DEBFULLNAME="Joe Bloggs"
  $ export DEBEMAIL="joe@example.com"

Once you have everything setup simply run ivtv-make-fwpkg on
the downloaded firmware file:

  $ ivtv-make-fwpkg pvr48wdm_1.8.22037.exe
  ivtv-make-fwpkg: Extracting firmware from pvr48wdm_1.8.22037.exe
  ivtv-make-fwpkg: Firmware is self-extracting .exe variety
  ivtv-make-fwpkg: Firmware version is 1.8.22037
  ...
  dh_builddeb
  dpkg-deb: building package `ivtv-firmware' in `../ivtv-firmware_1.8.22037_all.deb'.

A package ivtv-firmware_VERSION_all.deb will be created in the current
directory. You can install it in the usual manner:

  # dpkg -i ivtv-firmware_1.8.22037_all.deb
