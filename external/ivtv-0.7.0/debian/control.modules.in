Description: ivtv Linux kernel module (0.6 branch)
 The primary goal of the IvyTV Project is to create a kernel driver
 for the iTVC15 familiy of MPEG codecs. The iTVC15 family includes the
 iTVC15 (CX24315) and iTVC16 (CX24316). These chips are commonly found
 on Hauppauge's WinTV PVR-250 and PVR-350 TV capture cards.
 .
 This package contains the ivtv loadable kernel modules for the
 kernel-image-_KVERS_ package.
 .
 If you compiled a custom kernel, you will most likely need to compile a
 custom version of this module as well. The ivtv-source
 package has been provided for this purpose.
