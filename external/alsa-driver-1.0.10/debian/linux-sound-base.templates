_Choices: ALSA, OSS, default
Default: ALSA
_Description: Sound system to use
 ALSA and OSS are alternative systems of drivers for
 sound hardware.
 .
 If either ALSA or OSS is selected then in cases where
 both systems offer a driver, only the driver from the
 selected sound system will be automatically loaded by
 hotplug or discover. If "default" is selected then the
 choice of which drivers to load automatically will be
 left up to hotplug or discover and may depend upon the
 kernel version. Removing the linux-sound-base package
 effectively puts the system into "default" mode.
 .
 The ALSA sound system is recommended. Select OSS only if
 you are using a 2.4 kernel and you do not want to
 install an alsa-modules package, or if the OSS driver
 works with your hardware and the ALSA driver does not.
