  * New upstream development release
  * Thomas Hood
    - Drop dpatch applied upstream: 18_core_init_index
    - Add linux-sound-base package to allow choice between
      OSS and ALSA.  linux-sound-base takes over blacklisting
      functions from alsa-base.  alsa-base Depends on
      linux-sound-base which Suggests alsa-base.  2.6
      kernel-image packages should also Depend on linux-sound-base.
    - Update alsa-base Description and README.Debian accordingly
    - Add ALSA modem drivers to alsa-base's hotplug and discover
      blacklists. These drivers cause problems when loaded on some
      systems. They should be loaded when needed by the programs
      that use them.
    - /etc/init.d/alsa
      + Sanify "Dynamic Range Compression" at 70%
    - /etc/modutils/alsa-base:
      + Remove "options snd device_mode=0660"  (Closes: #299306)
    - /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base:
      + Add line to load snd-ioctl32 above snd which is needed on
        amd64  (Closes: #298082, #286915)
    - Eliminate duplicate copy of PATCHES in alsa-source doc dir
    - Configure module loader to load snd-emu10k1-synth above
      snd-emu10k1 and to call module loader hook. (Closes: #297802)
    - /etc/alsa/modprobe-post-install.d/alsa-base:
      + Match kernel version number more correctly. (Don't regard
        2.10.x as pre-2.6.)
    - Tweak config scripts
      + Run with bash since confmodule isn't POSIX
      + Add db_stop calls
    - alsa-base.postinst:
      + Delete backup file in /etc/hotplug/blacklist.d/ because
        hotplug does not ignore it  (#299205)
    - Add an upstream changelog cobbled together from messages sent
      to the alsa-announce mailing list.  This now gets installed as
      changelog.gz in alsa-source and alsa-modules* doc directories.
    - Ship copyright file for alsa-modules packages in
      /usr/src/modules/alsa-driver/debian
    - alsa-base.README.Debian

      + Shorten some function names; remove some bug checks

      feature which we use to implement blacklisting of OSS modules,

    - Stop alsa later (at [06]:K40alsa) so that shutdown music keeps

        the awesfx maintainer can arrange for asfxload to be run from
        /etc/alsa/modprobe-post-install.d/ when this module loads.
        (This would be to grant wish #246405.)  It seems that in

    - debian/control
      + Add "| kernel-source-2.4.27" to alsa-source's Recommendation

      + On force-stop, write list of removed modules to the file
        /var/run/alsa/modules-removed.  This is used for reloading
        modules after resume.
        (N.B. As of 1.0.8-2 you should use "force-unload" instead.)
      + Add "suspend" method which does force-stop and "resume"

        which won't get included in alsa-modules packages
    - debian/control
      + alsa-base:
        . Depend on lsof instead of psmisc  (Closes: #282755)
        . Suggest discover (>= 1.0.6) which now supports
          a form of blacklisting
      + alsa-source:
        . Depend on dpkg-dev for /usr/bin/dpkg-parsechangelog

      /lib/discover/alsa-base.pci-device.xml
      + Add files posted to #268006 (with 'busclass="0000"' removed from
        each device definition).  This gives ALSA modules precedence
        over OSS modules in discover's eyes.  (Closes: #268006)
        Many thanks to Jeff Licquia for adding the necessary functionality
        to the discover utility and for preparing these files.
    - debian/alsa-base.discover.pci-data.xslt
