Description: ALSA driver configuration files
 This package contains various configuration files for
 the ALSA drivers.
 .
 For ALSA to work on a system with a given sound card,
 there must be an ALSA driver for that card in the kernel.
 Linux 2.6 as shipped in linux-image packages contains
 ALSA drivers for all supported sound cards in the form
 of loadable modules. For either Linux 2.6 or Linux 2.4
 a custom alsa-modules package can be built from the
 sources in the alsa-source package using the make-kpkg
 utility (included in the kernel-package package). Some
 pre-built alsa-modules packages are available in the
 Debian archive. Please read the README.Debian file for
 information about loading modules.

Description: ALSA driver sources
 This package contains the source code for the ALSA drivers.
 The source code can be compiled into an alsa-modules package
 using the make-kpkg utility (available in the kernel-package
 package). Please note that the kernel headers must be
 installed to compile these modules.
