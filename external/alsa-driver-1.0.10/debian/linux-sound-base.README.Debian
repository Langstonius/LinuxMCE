sound system selection
----------------------
The sound system can be selected by running:

    dpkg-reconfigure linux-sound-base

When ALSA is selected, all OSS modules are blacklisted for hotplug and
discover1.  When OSS is selected, all ALSA modules are blacklisted for
hotplug and discover1.  The configuation of discover (version 2) is
done differently: for those and only those devices for which there is
both an ALSA and an OSS driver, the selection of sound system decides
between the two.  For those devices for which there is only an ALSA,
or only an OSS driver, the sound system selection has no effect.
