TODO for each new upstream release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Check Ubuntu patches at http://people.ubuntulinux.org/~scott/patches/
* Update debian/changelog.ALSA from release announcement
* Update debian/ALSA-card-list from configure, docs and sources 
* Update debian/ALSA-module-list and debian/OSS-module-list from
  the latest 2.6 kernel-image tree


TODO possibly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add debconf support for --with-card-options?

* Add alsa package?:

Package: alsa
Architecture: all
Depends: alsa-base, alsa-utils
Description: ALSA metapackage
 Install this package in order to pull in the packages
 needed to use the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.

changelog entry:
    - Add "alsa" metapackage Depending on alsa-base and alsa-utils


TODO if alsa-firmware package is ever added
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Move upstream changelog entries to alsa-firmware


NOTES
~~~~~

* Scripts run by modprobe (because of "install" entries in
  /etc/modprobe.d/*) inherit PATH from whatever runs modprobe.
  Remember that modprobe is run with PATH=/bin:/sbin from
  /etc/init.d/module-init-tools, so such scripts should be careful
  about running commands in /usr/sbin/ and /usr/bin/.

* The way that linux-sound-base "selects" the sound system is not
  entirely consistent.  For hotplug and discover1, _all_ of the modules
  in the opposite system are blacklisted.  For discover (version 2),
  only the modules in the opposite system are blacklisted for which
  there is an alternative in the selected system.  I decided to do it
  this way in order to limit the amount of work we have to do
  maintaining the related files.  It is fairly easy to update
  *-module-list by looking in /lib/modules/<latest-kernel>/kernel/ and
  it is reasonably easy to update
  linux-sound-base.*.discover2.pci-device.xml by looking in the latest
  /lib/discover/pci-device.xml for all the entries that contain
  "<data class='name'>snd-" and also the name of an OSS module.

  It might be worth the effort to generate the two
  linux-sound-base.*.discover2.pci-device.xml from a common source
  file since they are exactly the same except for the module names.

* We considered creating /dev/[snd/]aload(C[0-7]|SEQ) but it was
  decided that this doesn't deliver much benefit.  We have added
  module loader configuration lines that cause the module loader to
  load auxiliary modules on top of card driver modules.  Automatic
  loading in the presence of udev doesn't always work properly.

* If a module loader configuration line for a card driver module is
  added to /etc/mod(utils|probe.d)/alsa-base then the NOPOSTINSTALL
  tag should be added to that module's description in ALSA-card-list
  so that no configuration line will be autogenerated for it.
