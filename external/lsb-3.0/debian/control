Description: Linux Standard Base 3.0 core support package
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 This package provides an implementation of the core of version 3.0 of
 the Linux Standard Base for Debian on the Intel x86, Intel ia64
 (Itanium), IBM S390, and PowerPC 32-bit architectures with the Linux
 kernel.  Future revisions of the specification and this package may
 support the LSB on additional architectures and kernels.
 .
 The intent of this package is to provide a best current practice way
 of installing and running LSB packages on Debian GNU/Linux.  Its
 presence does not imply that we believe that Debian fully complies
 with the Linux Standard Base, and should not be construed as a
 statement that Debian is LSB-compliant.

Description: Linux Standard Base 3.0 support package
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.

 This package provides an implementation of all modules of version 3.0
 of the Linux Standard Base for Debian on the Intel x86, Intel ia64
 (Itanium), IBM S390, and PowerPC 32-bit architectures with the Linux
 kernel.  Future revisions of the specification and this package may

Description: Linux Standard Base 3.0 init script functionality
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.

Description: Linux Standard Base version reporting utility
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 The lsb-release command is a simple tool to help identify the Linux
 distribution being used and its compliance with the Linux Standard Base.
 LSB conformance will not be reported unless the required metapackages are
 installed.
 .
 While it is intended for use by LSB packages, this command may also
 be useful for programmatically distinguishing between a pure Debian
 installation and derived distributions.
