To build, run these two commands:
  ./configure
  make

Your user must be in /etc/sudoers for some of the build to work.
A line like this must be inserted if you are not in there yet:
youruser ALL=(ALL) ALL

The build is unlikely to work if you are logged in as root.

Also, the build will only work on an existing LinuxMCE install and
so far has only been tested on LinuxMCE 0704 installed from the DVD.

As of Oct 20th, 2007, most things do not build yet...
This will however install the packages needed to build most components
of the distro, with the notable exception of libxine.
