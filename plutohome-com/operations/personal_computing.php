      Pluto is a powerfull computing platform. You can browse over the Internet without mouse or keyboard.</p>

    <p>&bull; <strong><a name="super"></a>Super-simple for novices--no mouse, keyboard or pull-down menus!</strong><br>
      Every Pluto Media Director has a full computer built-in, and comes with a wireless keyboard+mouse so you can run all your favorite software. Today's high-def tv's are actually great for computing because they of the fantastic picture quality.</p>
      <p>The basic computing tasks, such as web browsing, are completely integrated into both the Orbiter and mobile phone. Just press 1 button on either the phone or the Orbiter, and it displays a list of your favorite bookmarks. Touch 1 and it will appear on the nearest tv. Hit 'off' and it goes away--just like all your other media.</p>
      <p>So, if you just want to check the weather or the latest news, just hit a button on your mobile phone and the page will show up on the tv. It doesn't get any simpler. Even those who are totally computer illiterate and still think a mouse is a small rodent can surf the internet without having to learn anything.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="powerful" id="powerful"></a>Powerful computing platform for advanced users</strong><br>
      If you are a pc power user, imagine having a server running multi Intel Xeon processors and a 10 terabyte (10,000 GB) RAID 5 array. Plus, each Media Director incorporates a high-powered PC inside with the latest hardware, such as a 200GB hard drive, up to an Intel Pentium 4 at 3.06Ghz Processor with 2 GB RAM. And you just press 1 button to switch between Linux and Windows. The Media Director also has video outputs for computer monitors, such as VGA and DVI, and the latest audio/video sub-system for use as a high-end gaming platform.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="network" id="network"></a>Network file share for each family member. Save files on the RAID array</strong><br>
      The RAID array in the Pluto Core has a capacity of up to 10 TB (that's 10,000 GB). But it's not just for your media!</p>
      <p>Pluto automatically creates a network share for each family member so you can put all your normal computer files there too. The advantage is that you will never lose your files due to a hard drive crash (the RAID array has built-in redundancy). And, you can access any of your files anytime, anywhere--Pluto automatically creates a password-protected personal web page for each family member.</p>
      <p>It's fully automatic and self-configuring--you don't have to do anything. </p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="automaticlly" id="automaticlly"></a>Automatically joins multiple homes together as one network</strong><br>
      When you have multiple homes with Pluto systems, they can all be joined as one. Every Pluto Core will automatically create a VPN (virtual private network) connection to the others. It's completely safe and fully encrypted. The benefit is that you can go from one house to another and know that you will still have access to all your files no matter where you are without the hassle of copying them.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="creates" id="creates"></a>Creates personal web pages for family members automatically</strong><br>
      The Pluto Core is a commercial-grade server, powered by Linux and running the Apache web server. Apache is the preferred web server for major corporations and internet portals, with a 67% market share, thanks to it's rock-solid reliability and strong security.</p>
      <p>The difference with Pluto is that, unlike the big corporations, you don't need a network administrator. Pluto's engineers developed special systems that make the Pluto Core 100% self-configuring.</p>
      <p>The Core automatically creates a personal web site for each family member so that he can control Pluto and access his files from anywhere in the world with a web browser, or with the mobile phone. Also, each family member can flag any media, like pictures, that he wants to share with the world, and the Core will create a personal home page. It's automatic--you don't even need to know how to type.</p>
      <p>So now the private, non-technical homeowner, can enjoy the reliability of a commercial web server.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="use" id="use"></a>Use your favorite Windows programs as well as free Linux software</strong><br>
      The computer world is divided into 2 operating system camps: Microsoft Windows is the most popular operating system for pc's. Unix/Linux is the operating system used by Apple, and the infrastructure of major corporations, as well as the choice for consumer electronics products: many PVR's, DVD Players, Game Consoles, phone systems, etc. are based on Linux..</p>
      <p>Each has it's advantages. And Pluto is one of the only bi-lingual products that blends both, leveraging the strengths of each platform. Linux is renowned for it's stability and performance, and it doesn't suffer from all the security holes, viruses and worms that Windows does. That's why Linux is most popular in high-end servers. And your Pluto Core is a Linux based server. This also protects all the Windows pc's in your home as well, since the Pluto Core becomes the firewall for the home. Linux is also famous for it's vast selection of top-notch--FREE--open source software.</p>
      <p>That's why the Pluto Media Directors run both Linux and Windows. They come pre-installed with popular Linux software, like OpenOffice. And if you want to run your favorite Windows programs, you just press a button, and the Media Director switches to Microsoft Windows. Each Media Director comes with a wireless keyboard+mouse, so you can use it for all your computing needs.</p>
