<p>Word of mouth is the best possible advertising for any business.  So Pluto makes our users actual partners, rewarding them for spreading the word about Pluto Home and PlutoVIP.  Even if you only try out the free Pluto Home and PlutoVIP and never buy anything, you still get rewarded for referring other users.  Here’s how it works: </p>

<p><b><u>Pluto Home</p></b></u>

<p>Pluto Home customers always fell into two distinct categories: 1) those who don’t want to bother with technology and prefer to buy a pre-configured, “take it out of the box and plug it in” <b><i>appliance</b></i>.  2) techies who just want the <b><i>software</b></i> so they can build their own systems. </p>

<p>Rather than being greedy and trying to charge both groups, we decided to focus our marketing exclusively on group 1—our appliance customers—and make the software free open source, so group 2 can have a Pluto system without cost.  We know these software-only customers are likely to have non-techie friends and family who want the same lifestyle, but lack the skills or desire to build and configure their own free systems.  So we offer a nice commission for referring a customer who buys a Pluto appliance.  Imagine that!  You can download the software without cost, start enjoying Brilliant Living today, AND get paid.  After all, the best sales people are those who already have Pluto and can provide first-hand testimonials.</p>

<p>Pluto is also a very compelling platform for hard goods manufacturers to make their products radically better, such as TV’s, automobiles, personal computers, etc.  Pluto offers at least 3% of any licensing revenues as a commission to whoever makes the referral.  If you have contact to one of the big manufacturers, this could be quite a nice bonus indeed.</p>

<p><a href="index.php?section=ref_comm">details on Pluto Home's commission structure</a></p>

<p><b><u>PlutoVIP</p></b></u>

<p>PlutoVIP is different.  It’s a free service that only becomes economically viable when a very large number of people begin using it.  This is similar to the web search engines.  They too are free services, but they proved so essential they became very valuable IPO’s.  Like Google and Yahoo.</p>

<p>Without a doubt PlutoVIP falls into the same category.  It is a pioneering new concept and undeniably everyone will be using this type of service one day.  Consumers always look for ways to simplify, lighten the load, and save money by getting more features out of the same devices.  The first mobile phones did nothing but place phone calls.  Now they store our contact list, agendas, they even have cameras and web browsers.  This trend will obviously continue—nobody wants to go back to the old days of lugging around big, bulky “stuff”.  PlutoVIP is the next evolution by eliminating the remaining unwanted bulk we have to lug around every day—that stack of frequent shopper cards, member IDs, specialty credit cards, etc., and making it faster, easier and safer to conduct simple, everyday transactions.  Once this type of service catches on consumers will never go back.  Like the web portals, PlutoVIP is free, simple, practical, needs only word of mouth to spread, and has the potential to grow at exponential rates. </p>

<p>So here is your chance to get in on the ground floor without investing a dime.  Pluto Home will continue to fund PlutoVIP for however long it takes to gain critical mass and become viable on its own.  At that time it will be spun off as an independent entity, and 10% of the company’s shares have been allocated for the early users who spread the word.  Every time you refer a user who signs up and registers a mobile phone, you get a point.  Refer a business and get 10 points per location.  It’s an easy sale.  Consider what a compelling case PlutoVIP makes.  For example airlines spend a fortune on check-in kiosks.  With PlutoVIP, when a passenger with a registered Bluetooth mobile phone enters the terminal his itinerary automatically shows up and he can check in securely on the phone.  Unlike the kiosks, it is secure, free, easier to use, and there is no expensive equipment to maintain, reducing cost by over 95% (details).  Fast food chains can also use PlutoVIP for self-service ordering and payment with an interactive, color menu right on the mobile phone (details).  PlutoVIP facilitates all sort of fast, easy transactions in addition to the VIP recognition features.  There are applications for virtually every type of business, and unlimited opportunities to earn points from referrals. </p>

</p>The 10% of PlutoVIP’s company shares will be distributed to the users in proportion to the points.  On June 1, 2005 when enough time has passed to gauge the rate of adoption and establish a realistic timeframe for spinning off PlutoVIP and launching it as an IPO, a binding contract will be emailed to all PlutoVIP users outlining the details including a timeline and additional requirements, such as providing a verifiable legal identity to redeem the points.  In the meantime you can track your points online.  Since PlutoVIP is an entirely new concept, we cannot make any guarantees or predictions as to the rate of acceptance and when or if it will be viable as an IPO.  But, you can rest assured that if PlutoVIP becomes as popular as we think it will, and you help in spreading the word, you will have a piece of it. </p>
