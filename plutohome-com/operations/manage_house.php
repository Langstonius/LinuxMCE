        Here you can see screen shot (click on the thumbnail to see a larger picture) of the Orbiter's screen so we can explain it's function.  Note that the picture has been shrunk and compressed for the web.  The actual picture quality is much better.</p>
      <p>When you pick up the Pluto Orbiter, just check the 2 'who' and 'where' buttons in the lower right. Because the Orbiters are shared by the whole family, unlike the mobile phone, you need to tell it who is using it so it can customize itself to your taste. If you're not that person, just touch the picture and you'll see pictures of all the family members. Also, the Orbiters are meant to control your whole house at a glance, so, if you want to control a room other than the one shown, just touch the button to select another room. The 5 'picture' buttons on the left each bring up maps that you let you control your whole house at once. The maps are &quot;lights&quot;, &quot;media&quot; which shows you everything that everybody is watching in the whole house, &quot;climate&quot; which shows temperature and climate settings, &quot;phone&quot; which shows all the current phone calls in the house, and &quot;security&quot; which shows a map of all the security zones.</p>
      <p>The yellow 'lighting' buttons are all your lighting scenarios, or moods. A mood can do more than just control lights. For example, &quot;Intimate&quot; could play some background music and set your status to 'do not disturb'. The gray buttons are all the media choices in this room. The green are you climate settings, as well as buttons for 'environment' controls, like pool and sprinkler. Touch the red 'phone' button to make a phone call. You will see your personal phone book and speed dials right on the tablet for easy browsing, and when you touch someone to call, Pluto will make the call for you and put it through on the nearest phone. The other red buttons are the current status of each family member, including the voice messages. You can see Michelle has 3 messages, Pedro is sleeping, and Marco doesn't want to be disturbed. Just touch your button to check messages or change your status. The 'blue' security button lets you set the alarm mode, and the various camera buttons are shortcuts to view surveillance cameras on the tablet--either quad view or single view. You can add miscellaneous options for each room. In this case, for Marco in the Master Bedroom, there's a cnn.com button that brings up that web page on the closest tv.</p>
      <p><center><a href="javascript:open_popup('operations/poza16.html','532','465')"><img src="images/img%20how%20to/06/06_1_m.jpg" width="141" height="112" border="0"></a>
      </center></p>
      <p>When something relevant happens, the screen will change automatically. If you put a dvd into a Media Director, the closest Orbiter will automatically go to the remote control. If you pick up the phone to make or answer a call, the closest Orbiter will show you 'call in progress' screen so it's very easy to transfer or conference just by touching the family members' pictures. If someone rings the door or trips the alarm, the surveillance camera will automatically pop up.</p>
      <p>The round, 4 way rocker button lets you scroll whatever is on the screen, including the program guide and the cameras. When you are at one of the remote control menus, the rocker turns into a skip up/down, fast forward/rewind control so that you can control the system with a physical button.</p>
      <p>You can also go to your customer setup page and choose what skin, or motif, you want for each Orbiter, like wood, marble, and so on.</p></td>
