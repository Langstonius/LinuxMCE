    <p>&bull; <strong><a name="since" id="since"></a>Home automation is just 1 of Pluto's 5 functions. Yet Pluto costs less than stand-alone home automation systems.</strong><br>
      The difference is actually greater than you probably imagined.  Home automation systems are usually controlled by a slew of expensive touch-screen tablets needed everywhere you want control. Only Pluto turns your mobile phone into a comfortable remote making the tablets optional. Plus the big expenses of installing a home automation system are the programming and running the cable. Pluto eliminates the programming altogether, since it is self-configuring.  And Pluto can even eliminate the cabling expense too.  How?</p>
      <p>Pluto runs everything, from phone calls to DVD movies, on a single Ethernet (cat 5) cable--the sort used for computer networks and also telephones.  There's a good chance your home already has cat 5 cable for the telephones, even if they're just the normal old-fashioned kind.  Most smart home solutions require you tear open the walls to run custom cabling.  But even the products that do use cat 5 still require you to run a new cable because none of them incorporates the phone system. With Pluto, we use the existing phone cable, turning it into a high speed network cable that handles hundreds of simultaneous phone calls, plus the media and everything else that Pluto offers.</p>
      <p>&bull;<strong> <a name="efortless"></a>Effortless, &quot;follow-me automatically&quot; automation</strong><br>
      A smart home system that is able to recognize each family member and automatically set up the room according to his preferences has long been the &quot;holy grail&quot; of home automation. A few billionaires have spent millions on custom systems to get this convenience. With Pluto, now you can enjoy this convenience too.</p>
      <p>Isn't it nice to know that when you enter a room, Pluto automatically prepares the room. We're not talking about a motion detector that simply detects movement and has no idea who is there. Just keep your mobile phone in your pocket and Pluto will pick up the unique serial number it broadcasts.  It compares the relative strengths throughout the house (patent pending) to calculate exactly where each family member is.  Touch 1 button on the phone to turn 'follow-me'.  It works for your lighting, and climate preferences.  Whatever music or media your watching and your phones calls also follow you, as well as security settings.</p>
      <p>Of course, you can turn some or all of follow-me off just by pressing a button on your mobile phone. </p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="control" id="control"></a>Control everything from your mobile phone--in the house or out (patent pending)</strong><br>
      Your mobile phone not only becomes more comfortable and useable than any type of remote control on the market, it works anywhere in the world you have cellular data coverage.  Control everything, monitor your cameras, accept deliveries...  It doesn't matter if you're in the Living Room or in Lithuania.  When you're at home, the mobile uses Bluetooth to communicate.  When you're away, it automatically switches to the cellular network.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="self" id="self"></a>Self-configuring and maintaining. *NO* programming or tech skills needed</strong><br>
      Ask anybody who has bought a home automation system and they will tell you a lot of programming is required--several weeks is not uncommon. And, whenever you want to make a change, you need to call the programmer back again. You can confirm this by visiting any home automation company's web site, and looking for the software downloads and the manuals. Compare that to Pluto. Everything is plug-and-play, self-configuring, and no programmer will ever come to your home.</p>
      <p>All you do is go to a simple web site, and answer questions about your lifestyle and answer mostly multiple-choice questions.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="zero" id="zero"></a>Zero-touch automation (patent pending)</strong><br>
      Because Pluto has so many pieces integrated, Pluto can anticipate your wishes and cater to them without you lifting a finger, unlike a home automation system.</p>
      <p>For example, let's say you have a dvd you want to watch. Just put the disc in the nearest media director. That's it. Pluto will analyze what type of disc it is, figure out if it's music or video, and setup all your tv and stereo equipment automatically. If it's a DVD, Pluto will even feed the DVD Menu directly to the nearest mobile phone or Orbiter. You don't have to touch a single button. show me</p>
      <p>Home automation products brag about push-button or touch-screen operation of lighting scenes, and so on. But none of them offer zero-touch, like Pluto does.</p>
