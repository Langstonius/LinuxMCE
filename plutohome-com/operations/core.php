      The Pluto Core is a commercial-grade server. However, it is entirely self-configuring. It does not even come with a mouse or a keyboard.  Just plug it in.</p>
      <p>Because the Core communicates with everything over the local area network, the connections are easy: just 2 standard network connectors, one for your internal network in the house, and one for your internet connection.</p>
      <p>Additionally, your Core will have jacks for whatever telephone lines you have. You do not actually need any phone lines--the core has a built-in voice-over-ip pbx switch that can route all incoming and outgoing calls over the internet. However we recommend that you always have at least one 'normal' phone line as a backup in case there is a problem with your internet connection. When you order your Core, just specify the quantity and type of phone connections you want. The Core supports POTS (normal analog phone lines), ISDN and T1, and can handle up to 96 phone lines, and 1,000 extensions.</p>
      <p>There are numerous accessories available, including devices that let you use your existing telephones as extensions on the Pluto phone system.</p>

          <br>
          Every home needs only one Core. This is the central server, the brains. You can tuck it away someplace safe--you will not need to 
access it. The only important thing to remember is that it is a powerful, multi-processor, commercial-grade sever. So it must stay in a 
cool, well ventilated place. As long as it stays cool, it will run like a champion. But, like all commercial servers, if it gets too hot it has 
thermal protection and will shut itself down. Also, because of the processing power and massive storage, it has several fans for it's active 
cooling system.  So it is not as quiet as a normal computer, and you probably would not want to put it in the open in a bedroom or a 
living room. The frame is a 4U, 19" rackmount. If you do not have a rack, you can put it on a shelf.
