    <p>&bull;<strong> <a name="#efortless"></a>Effortless video conferencing (answer and dial just like normal)</strong><br>
      Everybody likes the idea of the video phone and imagines that in the future it will replace the telephone. But, at the moment, video conferencing is too impractical--you need a computer, and special software. It doesn't work like the normal phone, and it's just too cumbersome.</p>
      <p>Well, the future is here. Pluto developed a special method to allow video calls to run behave just like your normal phone calls. If somebody calls you from a video phone, it rings on the phones in the house just like normal. The display shows you that the call has video, and you press 1 button to make the video appear on the nearest TV. But, it's still a normal call. You can transfer the call to someone else, whether or not they have a video phone. You can still put the call on hold, and pick it up on your mobile phone or cordless. As far as you're concerned, there's no difference.</p>
      <p>And, when you want to make a video call, you just dial like you would a normal call. Pluto figures it out automatically, and if both sides support video, a button appears to add it.  You have nothing to learn, no software to install, no special equipment. It's built into every Pluto media director, so Pluto automatically turns all your tv's into video phones.</p>
      <p>&bull;<strong> <a name="#touch" id="#touch"></a>&quot;Touch the picture&quot; transfer and conferencing</strong><br>
      One of the major drawbacks of a phone system is that it can be so complicated to use. Try to figure out how to do a conference call, or transfer to an outside line on a normal phone system.</p>
      <p>But with Pluto, whenever you're on the phone, the nearest Orbiter will automatically show you pictures of each family member. If you want to transfer, or conference, just touch the person's picture--it couldn't be easier. Even more sophisticated tasks, like transferring to an outside number, are super-simple with Pluto.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="#only" id="#only"></a>Only priority people can wake you</strong><br>
        As you add names to your personal phone book, be sure to check off which ones are priority people, like friends and family.  When you press the button on your mobile phone or on the Pluto Orbiter to go to sleep, not only does Pluto get the lights and the climate, it also adjusts your phone settings. Somebody who calls will automatically get voicemail, except for your priority callers who will be told that you are sleeping, and given the option of waking you. If they choose to do so, Pluto will put the call through to the phone by the bed so as not to disturb others in the house.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="#ties" id="#ties"></a>Tie all your homes together as one phone system</strong><br>
      If you have multiple residences, just tell your Pluto rep to join them.   Pluto will automatically sense what home you're in.  Anytime someone calls any of your homes--anywhere in the world--the call is automatically put through, unless you're sleeping.  Pluto uses voice-over-ip, so there are no long distance charges.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="#routes" id="#routes"></a>Always routes your calls to the extensin nearest you</strong><br>
      Pluto's 'follow-me' keep track of what room in the house you're in and your phone calls automatically ring on the extension nearest you.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong><a name="#remember" id="#remember"></a>Remembers who calls for whom and puts the call through automatically (patent pending)</strong><br>
      Often times, the same people always call for the same family members. For example, if one of your daughter's school friends calls, you know the call is for your daughter. So, rather than needing to answer the phone, and then track down your daughter or take a message like you do now, Pluto can remember who normally calls for whom and route the call automatically based on the caller ID.</p>
      <p>So the next time your daughter's friend calls, it will automatically ring in your daughter's room if that's where she is--without disturbing anyone else in the house.  If she's out, it will go automatically to her mobile phone if you wish.</p>
